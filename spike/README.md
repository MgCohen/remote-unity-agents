# Spike: Deterministic, Type-Safe Code Composition

> A spike to prove out a **deterministic, data-driven, type-safe** way to compose
> code from reusable fragments — the opposite of "ask an LLM to glue snippets
> together." Everything for this spike (this doc, code, generated output) lives in
> this folder.

This document is written to be **cold-readable**: you should be able to understand
the whole idea, why it's shaped the way it is, and what we're building, without
having seen the conversation that produced it.

## Invariants — the anchor (read this first)

These are the properties the whole effort must hold. Everything else (which dialect, which
milestone, which reference) is detail that serves them. Sharpened from §1's original constraint
table after the architecture-first pass (`flow-graphs.md` → `authoring-dialects.md`).

**What the LLM does — four bounded positions (not "writes no code").** The LLM stays the author
throughout; the system constrains *where and how* it authors. The positions run in **workflow order**:

1. **Analyze / select** — first, read the task and pick which recipes & components fit (intent → catalog).
2. **Compose** — wire the chosen components into a recipe (output→input). The structured, minimal-dialect bulk.
3. **Author the missing** — if no component matches what the feature needs, you **do not wire it in
   place.** You stop, step out to a *separate* session, author (or alter) the component properly,
   clean it, and come back to use it. A deliberate detour out of composition — never an inline
   improvisation. This is how the catalog grows (the ratchet); a cleaned component carries the hard
   standards so every later composition inherits them.
4. **Glue** — the irreducibly-custom middle: *how* an element is found in a repository (a
   predicate/lambda), *how* it's changed (a few lines). No way around it — it is the feature's
   business logic. Made small and standardized, dropped into a **typed slot**. The only thing
   genuinely hand-written *in place*.

The **deterministic** part is only the *lowering* (recipe → owned source). Authorship of the recipe
and its glue is the LLM's; what's enforced is the *composition*, not the absence of the author.

### Invariants — must hold (a guard or the compiler can assert these)

- **Type-safe.** Illegal compositions don't compile. The type system *is* the schema — no JSON, no
  runtime validator, no "looks right."
- **Deterministic lowering.** A fixed recipe → the same owned source, byte-for-byte. "Input" =
  recipe + catalog version + toolchain (Roslyn/formatter). No model *in the lowering step*.
- **Structured.** You can only wire what the catalog holds. New *behavior* enters only as an authored
  component (position 3) — never improvised inline; the only hand-written code in place is the glue.
- **Custom glue is bounded.** Hand-written code is allowed only as the feature's irreducible business
  logic — a predicate / query / a few lines — at a **typed leaf or block slot, never a new top-level
  form.** Small and standardized, never zero.
- **Owned output, via explicit emit.** Generated code is normal, committed `.cs` — materialized only
  by an explicit *emit*, never invisible weaving. The live-vs-emitted policy below governs it.
- **Standards land on the output, not the components.** The generated code must pass the product's
  good-practice bar / rulebooks. The **components do not** — they are a custom source-generation
  toolchain we are building. Judge a component by the code it *emits*, not by how it reads.

### Design principles — guide choices (not build-failing)

- **The LLM authors, within structure.** It writes code in all four positions — *not* zero code. What
  it cannot do is improvise *structure*. ("Deterministic" governs the lowering; "structured" governs
  the authoring.)
- **Minimal dialect — in the wiring.** The composition surface (position 2) is a small, regular,
  unambiguous vocabulary — few forms, no dialect *choice* — so an agent emits it reliably. The glue
  slot (position 4) is necessarily freer; minimal dialect is a property of the *wiring*, not the glue.
- **Source-generation back-fills inline — bounded.** The author declares a need at the use-site
  (`new CreateRecord("X")`, `scope.Get<T>`) and the generator mints it — but only **types / DI /
  plumbing from a fixed grammar, never new behavior.** New behavior enters only as a component.
- **Recipe and components are tools, optimized for agent delivery.** The audience is an *agent
  composing*, not a human reading the recipe. The recipe and the components are tooling; **the
  generated output is the artifact** that gets read, reviewed, tested, owned.
- **Components carry the standards — with leeway.** A cleaned component *encodes* the hard standards
  so output inherits them, but the component itself follows *its own* internal conventions, not the
  product's. Leeway in, standard code out.
- **Ratchet growth (build-once-then-reuse).** No speculative abstraction. When we hit something not
  yet built, we build it once, clean it into a component (position 3), and it is reusable forever.
  The library grows by harvesting *real* recurring need — YAGNI as a growth model.

### Emit — live vs emitted (the regeneration policy)

Two states, one explicit gate between them:

- **Live (working) recipe** — as you edit, it self-generates *continuously, in place* (a preview).
  The recipe is the source of truth; nothing here is hand-edited. ("Live" = continuously
  self-generating, not "editable output.")
- **Emit** — an explicit action (command / button / step). It materializes the *real* artifact at the
  **configured target**: real files in the correct folders, proper namespaces, samples — whatever the
  output needs. Once emitted, that artifact is **detached** — continued live editing never touches it.
- **Re-emit overrides.** Emit again with the same config and it overwrites the target; expected and
  fine. It also **clobbers any manual edits** to the emitted files — accepted for now, no auto-sync.
- **Out of scope (future):** reconciliation / protected-region checks. A manual edit to emitted code
  is a *signal*, not a workflow — either the business rule changed (pull it back into the recipe) or
  you need a different structure (make a recipe **variation** others can reuse — goes direct instead
  of via a repository, a different technology, etc.).

## Document map — active vs parked

One north star, explored from several entry points. **Parked ≠ legacy** — paused, resumable threads.

| State | Docs | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| **Anchor** | `README.md` (this), `NORTH-STAR.md` | the invariants + the `Intent→…→Feature` vision/roadmap |
| **Active** | `flow-graphs.md`, `authoring-dialects.md`, `PROBES.md` (+ the probe dirs: `probe-a…e/`, `integration-slice/`, `leverage-probe/`, `extraction-probe/`) | architecture-first thread: RiverBooks flows → motifs → authoring surface → **runnable technical proofs** of the mechanics, ending at the **typed dialect** (`extraction-probe/`) |
| **Parked — mechanism (recipe→code)** | `PHASE-2`, `DECLARATION-TIER`, `BUILDING-STYLE` + `src/ gen/ out/ tests/` | proved the lowering mechanism bottom-up; `authoring-dialects.md` supersedes `BUILDING-STYLE`'s authoring pass |
| **Parked — intent→recipe (the other end)** | `PROMPT-DECOMPOSITION`, `PLAN-TO-RECIPES`, `decomposition-*`, `scheduled-runs.*`, `project-*`, `projects-*`, `favorite-artist.plan` | how intent becomes a recipe (decomposition) — a different axis |

**Working rule: enrich the anchor; do not spawn sibling docs.** New thinking folds into the active
docs or the invariants above.

## 1. The problem

We want a system where:

- A catalog of **snippets** exists — e.g. one that "knows how to do a loop", one
  that "knows how to add two ints".
- Something (a human, or an **agent**) declares a **combination** of those
  snippets.
- The system **merges them into a single, coherent piece of real C# code** —
  e.g. *a loop that sums the indices*.

Hard constraints (these are the whole point — drop any one and the design changes). *The
canonical, sharpened list is the **Invariants** block up top; this is the original framing:*

| Constraint | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Deterministic** | Same input → same output, byte for byte. No model in the loop. |
| **Data-driven** | The combination is *declared as data*, not hand-written each time. |
| **Type-safe** | Illegal compositions fail to compile — not at runtime, not "looks wrong". |
| **Agent-first** | An LLM agent authors the combination; the structure must constrain it and validate it *for free*. |
| **Owned output** | The generated code is a normal `.cs` file you can read, commit, and hand-edit. Not invisible compiler magic. |

Non-goal: a general "compile any C#" engine. We model the **vocabulary our agents
actually compose in**, and grow it deliberately.

---

## 2. Glossary

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Snippet** | A reusable code fragment, authored as a **real, compiling C# method** with typed **fills**. The method body *is* the template. |
| **Fill** | A gap in a snippet, filled at composition time. Three forms: **param**, **marker**, **block** (see §4.2). |
| **Param** | A *value* fill — a by-value parameter, filled with an expression. |
| **Marker** | A *name* fill — an `@`-identifier (or `ref` param), filled with a name. |
| **Block** | A *region* fill — `Block.Of("id")`, filled with statements. |
| **Atom** | A primitive expression node too trivial to be a snippet (`Lit`, `Ref`). Hand-written. |
| **Recipe** | The **combination**, declared as a typed tree of records. This is what the agent writes. |
| **Node** | One entry in a recipe (e.g. `LoopNode`). **Generated from the snippet** (see §4.4). |
| **Generator (tool)** | A standalone one-shot program: recipe → `ScriptData.cs`. |

Two **separate** generation steps — do not conflate them:

1. **Source generation (in-build, always on):** snippets → typed recipe **nodes**
   (the *vocabulary* the agent writes against).
2. **The one-shot tool (run on demand):** a recipe instance → `ScriptData.cs`
   (the *artifact* you commit and own).

---

## 3. TL;DR of the design

- A **snippet is a real C# method** annotated `[Snippet]`. Its body is genuine,
  compiler-checked code with typed fills. You can author it, rename its variables,
  and get type errors — like any code.
- **Fills come in three forms** (param, marker, block), all visible in the method
  signature/body, all type-checked.
- The snippet's **signature is its contract** — exactly like `Func<>`/`Action<>`:
  the return type says what it produces, the parameters are its value fills (params).
- A **recipe** is a **typed tree of records** the agent writes. The record types
  are **source-generated from the snippets**, so they can't drift, and the agent
  gets IntelliSense + compile-time validation. The type system *is* the schema —
  no JSON, no hand-written validator.
- Recipe nodes share a normalized base — `IExpr<T>` (produces a value) /
  `IStmt` (produces statements) — so **composition is type-checked**: an `int`
  param rejects a `string`-producing node at authoring time.
- A **standalone tool** lowers a recipe to a plain `ScriptData.cs` you commit and
  may hand-edit (emit stays a *tool*, not a source generator). Roslyn parses snippet
  bodies and substitutes fills at the node level; **type rendering now goes through the
  semantic model** (`ITypeSymbol.ToDisplayString`, probe D), not reflection — see
  `PROBES.md` → *Decision recorded*.
- **Type-safety is two-stage:** each snippet compiles in isolation (authoring); the
  assembled `ScriptData.cs` compiles (the composition gate).

---

## 4. The model

> **Note:** §4–§5 describe the *original* model and use its API (`string` markers, `Ref`,
> `IExpr<T>`/`IStmt`). The composition *mechanism* (parse snippet bodies, substitute fills) is
> unchanged — but **type rendering has moved from reflection `Type.FullName` to the Roslyn semantic
> model** (`ITypeSymbol.ToDisplayString`); the recorded decision is in `PROBES.md` → *Decision
> recorded*, not here. The authoring surface also moved on (`Var<T>` handles, `Expr<T>`/`Stmt` bases,
> factories, operators); for that API shape see `BUILDING-STYLE.md` (parked).

### 4.1 A snippet is a real compiling method

```csharp
[Snippet("define", Inline)]
void Define<T>(T value) { T @var = value; }
```

This **compiles**. `@var` is a legal identifier (the `@` escapes the `var`
keyword), so `T @var = value;` type-checks: rename, IntelliSense, and error
squiggles all work. The body is the template; the generator substitutes the fills.

> **The breakthrough.** Earlier we believed a *variable declaration* couldn't be a
> real snippet, because the declared **name** isn't an expression you can put a
> placeholder into. `@var` solves it: a placeholder *identifier* that compiles and
> is swapped at generation. This unified "trivial primitives" and "boilerplate"
> into **one model** (annotated methods with fills) instead of two.

### 4.2 The three fill forms

Fills are encoded so the snippet still compiles and the generator can find them:

| Form | How it's written | Filled by | Generated node field |
|---|---|---|---|
| **param** | a by-value parameter (`int value`, `int count`) | a rendered child **expression** | `IExpr<T>` |
| **marker — new** | an `@`-prefixed identifier *declared* in the body (`int @var = …`, `for (int @i …)`) | a name **string** from the recipe | `string` |
| **marker — existing** | an `@`-prefixed **`ref` parameter** (`ref int @target`) — a variable the snippet mutates/reads | a name **string** from the recipe | `string` |
| **block** | `Block.Of("id")` | a rendered child **block** (its statements) | `Block` |

Conventions the generator keys on:

- **`@`-prefixed identifier = marker.** Invisible to the C# compiler (it's a
  valid identifier, so the snippet compiles), meaningful to our generator. Used
  even when no keyword-escape is needed — `@` *is* our "this name is a placeholder" sigil.
- **by-value param = param fill**, **`ref` param = existing-name marker.** A `ref`
  param is exactly "a variable that already exists, which I mutate" — and it makes
  a mutation snippet like `Assign` compile *in isolation* (without it, `@target =
  value;` wouldn't compile because `@target` would be undeclared).
- **`Block.Of("id")` = block.** The id names the region; the generated node field
  takes its name (`"then"` → `Then`), and the recipe fills it with a `Block`.

### 4.3 Signature = contract (the Func/Action normalization)

We don't need a base class on the snippet methods — the **signature already is the
contract**, exactly like the BCL normalizes shapes into `Func<>`/`Action<>`:

```csharp
int  Add(int a, int b)   // == Func<int,int,int>  → produces an int
void Define<T>(T value)  // == Action<T>          → produces statements
```

The **return type** is what the snippet produces; the **parameters** are its value
fills (params). The generator reads this to decide whether the recipe node is an
`IExpr<T>` or an `IStmt`.

### 4.4 The recipe: a typed tree, generated from the snippets

The recipe nodes are **source-generated** from the `[Snippet]` methods — single
source of truth, no drift, full IntelliSense. The generator reads each snippet's
fills and emits a node implementing the normalized base:

```csharp
interface IStmt;            // produces statement(s)        — Action-like
interface IExpr<out T>;     // produces a value of type T   — Func-like
```

So `void Loop(int count) { for (int @i = 0; @i < count; @i++) { Block.Of("body"); } }`
mechanically generates:

```csharp
record LoopNode(IExpr<int> Count, string I, Block Body) : IStmt;
```

`Count` (param) → `IExpr<int>`; `@i` (new-name marker) → `string`;
`Block.Of("body")` (block) → `Block`. Because the node carries its produced
type, **composition is statically correct by construction**: an `int` param only
accepts `IExpr<int>`; plug in a `string` producer and it won't compile.

### 4.5 Generation of the artifact

A **standalone tool** (a `dotnet run` console program, *not* a Roslyn source
generator) lowers the recipe:

1. Walk the recipe tree.
2. For each node, find its snippet (by `[Snippet]` key / type map).
3. Parse the snippet body with Roslyn (`ParseStatement`/`ParseExpression`).
4. Substitute fills at the **node level**:
   - markers → swap the `@`-identifier / `ref`-param name for the recipe string,
   - params → swap the param reference for the recursively-rendered child,
   - blocks → replace the `Block.Of("id")` call with the rendered child block.
5. For `Inline` snippets, drop the method wrapper and keep the (substituted) body.
6. Assemble into one tree → `NormalizeWhitespace().ToFullString()` → write
   `ScriptData.cs`.

**We parse real C# and swap leaves — we never hand-build `BinaryExpression(...)`
trees.** That keeps the authoring visible (you read `a + b`, not factory calls)
while still getting typed nodes that compose and format cleanly.

> **Updated (probe D).** The snippet-body splice above is unchanged, but rendering a **type** to its
> source text now goes through `ITypeSymbol.ToDisplayString` over a `Compilation` (idiomatic-or-FQN,
> usings derived), not reflection `Type.FullName`. Emit is still a *tool* (this whole §4.5) — just a
> `Compilation`-backed one. Recorded in `PROBES.md` → *Decision recorded*.

`Inline` vs `Call` is a per-snippet mode (attribute flag). Inline splices the body
(only valid for single-expression / simple bodies); Call emits an invocation. The
spike does **Inline only**.

### 4.6 Type-safety is two-stage

| Stage | When | What it checks |
|---|---|---|
| **Snippet** | you author a `[Snippet]` method | the fragment is well-formed C#; fills are typed; rename works |
| **Recipe** | the agent writes the recipe | structure + `IExpr<T>`/`IStmt` wiring — illegal compositions don't compile |
| **Composition** | the generated `ScriptData.cs` builds | the assembled whole (scope, types across snippet boundaries) |

Nothing is validated "by convention" or by vibes. The C# compiler is the gate at
every stage.

---

## 5. Worked example: `loop + var + sum`

Goal: generate code that sums the loop indices `0..4` → `10`.

### 5.1 The snippets (authored, all compile in isolation)

```csharp
[Snippet("define", Inline)]
void Define<T>(T value) { T @var = value; }

[Snippet("assign", Inline)]
void Assign<T>(ref T @target, T value) { @target = value; }

[Snippet("add", Inline)]
int Add(int a, int b) => a + b;

[Snippet("loop", Inline)]
void Loop(int count) { for (int @i = 0; @i < count; @i++) { Block.Of("body"); } }

[Snippet("return", Inline)]
T Return<T>(T value) { return value; }
```

Plus two hand-written **atoms** (too trivial to be snippets):

```csharp
record Lit(int Value)   : IExpr<int>;   // 0, 5
record Ref(string Name) : IExpr<int>;   // acc, i
record Block(IReadOnlyList<IStmt> Statements);
```

### 5.2 The generated recipe nodes (from §4.4)

```csharp
record DefineNode<T>(string Var, IExpr<T> Value)           : IStmt;
record AssignNode<T>(string Target, IExpr<T> Value)        : IStmt;
record AddNode(IExpr<int> A, IExpr<int> B)                 : IExpr<int>;
record LoopNode(IExpr<int> Count, string I, Block Body)    : IStmt;
record ReturnNode<T>(IExpr<T> Value)                       : IStmt;
```

### 5.3 The recipe (what the agent writes)

```csharp
var recipe = new Block(new IStmt[]
{
    new DefineNode<int>(Var: "acc", Value: new Lit(0)),
    new LoopNode(
        Count: new Lit(5),
        I:     "i",
        Body:  new Block(new IStmt[]
        {
            new AssignNode<int>(
                Target: "acc",
                Value:  new AddNode(new Ref("acc"), new Ref("i")))
        })),
    new ReturnNode<int>(new Ref("acc")),
});
```

### 5.4 The generated `ScriptData.cs`

```csharp
int acc = 0;
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
{
    acc = acc + i;
}
return acc;
```

### 5.5 How the wiring happens (the crucial bit)

Nothing magically knows "sum the index into the count." It is **stated** by the
recipe, against the contract each snippet publishes:

- `Define.@var` ← `"acc"`, `Loop.@i` ← `"i"`, `Assign.@target` ← `"acc"`.
- `Assign.value` ← `Add(Ref("acc"), Ref("i"))`, which renders `acc + i`.
- The snippets share variables **by name** — the recipe uses `"acc"` / `"i"`
  consistently. The loop only loops; the accumulator comes from a *separate*
  `Define`; the addition is a *separate* `Add`. Each snippet is ignorant of the
  others; the recipe is the wiring.

(This §4–§5 API — `string` markers, `Ref("acc")`, `IExpr<T>`/`IStmt` — is the **original** design.
It has since been superseded: names are instance-derived `Var<T>` handles (backlog #1, done), and the
bases are `Expr<T>`/`Stmt` records. The current authoring surface is in `BUILDING-STYLE.md`.)

---

## 6. Design decisions & rejected alternatives

These are the insights — *why* the design is shaped this way, and what we tried and
discarded.

| Alternative | Why we rejected it |
|---|---|
| **Metalama** (C#-to-C# compile-time templates) | Excellent for type-safe templates **woven via attributes at compile time**. But our composition is driven by a **typed recipe** and we want an **owned source artifact**, not invisible weaving. Its grain is "composition expressed in C#," not "recipe data → file you commit." We'd end up using its underlying Roslyn anyway. |
| **Record IR for *content*** (encode the `for` loop as `new Loop(...)`, lower via `SyntaxFactory`) | The actual code (`for (...)`) then **lives nowhere readable or editable** — it's synthesized by factory calls. You lose authoring, rename, and type-checking of the boilerplate. **Content must live in real source.** |
| **`SyntaxFactory` tree-building as the renderer** | Verbose and **invisible**: you write `BinaryExpression(SyntaxKind.AddExpression, …)` and can't *see* `a + b` until it renders. Wrong tool for authoring. (We still use Roslyn — but to **parse** real C# and **substitute** leaves, not to build trees by hand.) |
| **JSON recipe** | Records give the same structure **plus the type system as a free schema** — no parser, no validator, and compile-time validation for the agent. JSON buys nothing here. |
| **Record carrying a `Code` string** (`override string Code => "T [name] = value"`) | Typed *inputs*, but the `Code` string is an **unvalidated** blob — you lose authoring-time validation of the *output*, the exact thing we want. A real method (`[Snippet]`) validates the output **and** co-locates the template. |
| **`Slot.Body(params object[])`** | A generic `Slot.Of<T>()` makes the slot's produced **type visible and checked at authoring**; `params object[]` tells you nothing. |
| **Two-grain split** (records for trivial leaves, snippets for boilerplate) | Made redundant by `@var`: once declarations can be real snippets, **everything is one model** — annotated methods with fills. Simpler. |

---

## 7. The spike plan

**Hypothesis to prove:** we can take authored `[Snippet]` methods + a typed recipe
and deterministically emit a plain, compiling `ScriptData.cs` — with the snippets
validated at authoring and the composition validated by the type system.

### 7.1 Folder layout

```
spike/
  README.md             ← this doc
  src/
    SnippetAttribute.cs ← the [Snippet] marker attribute
    Snippets.cs         ← the [Snippet] methods (§5.1)
    Nodes.cs            ← IExpr<T>, IStmt, atoms, and Block (with Block.Of marker)
    Nodes.Generated.cs  ← the recipe nodes, source-generated by spike/gen (Step 2)
    Generator.cs        ← recipe → C# (parse snippet bodies, substitute fills, assemble)
    Program.cs          ← Main: build the recipe, run the generator, write out/ScriptData.cs
  gen/                  ← Step 2: emits Nodes.Generated.cs from the [Snippet] methods
  tests/                ← the regression net
  out/
    ScriptData.cs       ← the generated artifact (committed, to show the output)
```

### 7.2 Step 1 — core merge (the real proof)

- Implement `Block.Of`, the five snippets, the atoms, and **hand-written** recipe nodes
  (defer source-gen — it's mechanical; the *merge* is the risk).
- Implement the generator: parse each snippet body, substitute the three fill forms,
  inline, assemble, format, write the file.
- **Inline mode only.**

### 7.3 Step 2 — source-gen the nodes (only if Step 1 proves out)

- Replace the hand-written recipe nodes with a Roslyn **source generator** that
  reads `[Snippet]` methods and emits `IExpr<T>`/`IStmt` nodes from the fills.

### 7.4 Out of scope (parked — see §8)

Source-gen (until Step 2), `Call` mode, implicit literal conversions,
instance-derived names, context-based variations, raw/custom code, interface
renames, snippet base-class.

### 7.5 Done-when

1. Running the tool on the `loop + var + sum` recipe emits a `ScriptData.cs` that
   **compiles** and, when executed, **returns `10`** (`0+1+2+3+4`). ✅
2. **Editing a snippet body** (e.g. the loop bound `<` → `<=`) **flows through** to
   the output — proving the generator reads live snippet source, not a hardcoded
   template. ✅ *(Note: the output variable **name** is recipe-controlled — it comes
   from `LoopNode.I` / `Ref("i")`, not the marker. The `@i` marker is the fill's
   identity, bound by convention to the node field `I`; in Step 2 the field is
   generated from the marker, so they always agree.)*
3. A deliberately wrong recipe (a `string` producer into an `int` param) **fails to
   compile** — `CS1503: cannot convert from 'string' to 'IExpr<int>'`. ✅

---

## 8. Backlog

**This is the canonical backlog — record deferred/parked items here**, not in `NORTH-STAR.md`
(which holds only the north-star vision + the milestone *roadmap*, and references items here by
number). Revisit each **against running code**. As the spike grew, some items (the declaration
tier, #7–9) moved **into** it and now carry a status; the rest stay parked.

1. ✅ **DONE — Variable names on the instance, not a recipe field** — shipped as `Var<T>`
   handles (Phase 2b); a declaration binds a handle, a use references it, the name is chosen once.
2. ✅ **DONE — Implicit conversion operators for literals** — shipped as lever D
   (`implicit operator Expr<T>(T)` + generic `Lit<T>`). The "does it hide a type error?" test is
   answered in `BUILDING-STYLE.md` (the generic-`Lit<T>` fix keeps it exactly typed). One known
   trap fell out: the `==` operator does record-equality — see that doc.
3. **Recipe variations by context** — same recipe → different output by context
   (target framework, flags, config). *Test:* where the branch lives — recipe, a
   context object, or composition.
4. **Custom code without a recipe** — an escape hatch (`Raw("…")` node / passthrough
   block) for code not modeled as snippets. *Test:* coexistence with typed nodes;
   effect on the final-compile gate.
5. **Rename the interfaces** — *partially overtaken*: `IExpr<T>`→`Expr<T>` and `IStmt`→`Stmt`
   (the interface→record flips), though not semantically renamed. The names are still opaque;
   find clearer, domain-fit ones. *Test:* what reads best in a real recipe.
6. **Snippet base class vs attribute** — *sharpened (see `BUILDING-STYLE.md`).* A snippet could be a
   **class** — `class Loop(int count) : Snippet { public override void Body() {…} }` — instead of an
   annotated method: fills as ctor params (still *inner*-typed, so the template in `Body()` still
   compiles and the gen tool still lifts them), metadata (`Name`, `Style`) as overrides, no attribute.
   It **keeps** the compiling-template breakthrough and does **not** unify snippet with node (the node
   still needs *outer* `Expr<T>` types to compose, so `LoopNode`/factory stay generated). Real wins:
   key derived from the class name (kills the `"loop"` duplication), produced type explicit via the
   base (`Snippet` vs `Snippet<int>`) instead of the body-kind gotcha, and `Style` as a typed override
   that scales as metadata grows. *Decision:* keep methods now (terser, tiny catalog, Inline-only);
   switch to class-based snippets when metadata grows past key+style, a base needs shared behavior, or
   the declaration tier (#7) brings structured method/type snippets.

### The declaration tier (items 7–9: grow *up* from statement bodies)

Everything so far composes the **body** of a fixed shell — the tool hardcodes
`public static class ScriptData { public static int Run() { <recipe> } }` and the
recipe only fills the `<recipe>` statements. Items 7–9 are the same modeling move
applied one level up: from "compose statements" to "compose declarations." They
share a spine — a **member region** is to a type what a `Block` is to a method.

> **Status — M1 shipped the type tier** (`DECLARATION-TIER.md` / `NORTH-STAR.md` M1): hand-authored
> `TypeNode` nodes (record/class/struct/enum) + a `TypeEmitter`, gated by compile + reflect. So **#8 is
> done** (via structural nodes, not a type-`[Snippet]` — a deliberate divergence), **#9 is answered**
> (members are a typed `Field[]`, *not* a `Block` — a field slot rejects a statement, by design), and
> **#7 is now mostly done** (the method tier added `MethodNode` — a class member whose body is the
> body tier, compiled + invoked), and **#11 stays partial** (no single root/result spine yet).

7. **What the generated element *is*** — the output shell (class? method? what
   name / return type / params?) is **not modeled** today; it's baked into the
   generator. Model a declaration tier: a `MethodNode` (name, return type, params,
   `Block` body) and the existing recipe becomes that method's body, not the whole
   artifact. *Test:* does today's `Block`/`IStmt` nest cleanly as a `MethodNode`'s
   body with zero change below it? Does the class shell stay hardcoded, or become a
   `ClassNode` whose members are themselves nodes?
8. **Defining new types** — a recipe can't introduce a type (`record Foo(int X)`,
   `class Bar { … }`). Express a type definition as a `[Snippet]` whose body is a
   type decl — `@`-marker for the type name, a region fill for its members.
   *Test:* do the existing fill forms reach a type name + member list, or does a
   member region need a new form distinct from `Block` (you can't drop a statement
   where a field goes)?
9. **Adding a field to a type** — once a type is a node, attaching a field/property
   (`int @name;`) should be the *same* operation as adding a statement to a block:
   fill a region. *Test:* is a member list just another `Block` (region fill), so
   field-add ≡ statement-add — or do members need their own region type so the
   compiler rejects a statement-in-a-field-slot?

### Freer code at a position (item 10)

10. **Host-language code at typed leaf positions** — some fills are tedious to model
    as node trees but trivial to write as plain C#: the `If` condition is the
    motivating case, authored as a lambda `() => i < 3` instead of
    `new LessThanNode(new Ref(i), new Lit(3))`. A lambda buys real C# type-checking
    and IntelliSense at the leaf while staying capturable. Overlaps the `Raw("…")`
    escape hatch (#4), but is **typed** where Raw is a string blob. *Test:* can a
    lambda body be lowered to source deterministically (`CallerArgumentExpression`
    on the param, or expression-tree → text)? Where's the line — raw/lambda allowed
    **only** at typed leaf-expression slots, never where a `Block` is expected? And
    note the tension with operator sugar (see `BUILDING-STYLE.md`): `acc + i` solves
    the same "don't hand-build expression nodes" itch while staying *inside* the
    type system, where a lambda steps outside it.
    > **Largely answered — `spike/extraction-probe/`.** A lambda body *can* be lowered
    > deterministically — not via `CallerArgumentExpression`/expression-trees, but by
    > **lifting the lambda's Roslyn syntax** from the recipe source and splicing it into the
    > owned output (renaming params to canonical names). It extends past leaf expressions to a
    > full **statement block** (the `With((agg,cmd,scope)=>{ … })` divergence), so the "never
    > where a `Block` is expected" worry is relaxed: a block lambda is a legitimate typed glue
    > slot. The leaf stays *typed* (the compiler checks every access against the real domain) and
    > carries **0 free-text strings**. The decision tilts to **typed lambda leaf** over `Raw("…")`
    > for business glue; the residual is the syntactic-vs-semantic rename (probe notes the
    > semantic-model upgrade).

### The type spine (item 11)

11. **A "result" type above `Block`** — today `Block` is the de-facto root (the
    recipe *is* a `Block`) and the surrounding element is hardcoded by the tool, so
    nothing models the **end result** as a value. Question: do we want a type above
    `Block` that names what's being produced (a method? a class? a file?), and is
    the whole model one **containment spine** — `<result> → Block → … → Var<T>` — with
    each tier owning the next? Overlaps #7 (the declaration tier models the
    *member*); this asks the orthogonal question of whether there's a single root
    node and a coherent spine all the way down to the variable handle. *Test:* is the
    root just the top declaration node from #7, or a distinct `Result`/`Program`
    wrapper? Is the spine pure **containment** (a result *has* blocks, a block *has*
    statements, a statement *references* a `Var<T>`), or does any tier actually want
    **inheritance** — and if nothing does, say so, so we don't reach for a base type
    the structure doesn't ask for.

### Recipe model & emitter (items 12–19: parked from the M1/M2 build)

Terminology settled here: **a recipe is any node** — the whole typed tree, primitive
(`RecordNode`, `LoopNode`, `Var`) up to a composite that builds a subtree. A node is *already* a
parameterized recipe, so there is no wrapper "recipe class." These are what the type-tier build
deliberately left for later; bracketed tags map to `NORTH-STAR.md` milestones.

12. **Catalog surface / matcher seam** [M3] — a recipe needs a catalog **name + description +
    param schema** so an LLM can *select and parameterize* it; an `IRecipe` **marker** over
    `Stmt`/`Expr`/`TypeNode` joins when a consumer (the matcher half of the system) needs to handle
    recipes uniformly. Built once at M2 and **removed as premature** — no consumer yet. *Test:* the
    marker stays a marker; composition slots stay typed (`Block` holds `Stmt[]`), or type-safety is lost.
13. **Composite recipes (`Build()` → subtree)** — a recipe that expands to *many* nodes (a service:
    class + interface + repo + DI), the Flutter `StatelessWidget.build()` pattern, typed so a
    composite *is-a* the category it produces. Reserve until a genuinely multi-node recipe forces it
    (`ScaffoldService`); a 1:1 wrapper earns nothing. Overlaps #18.
14. **Inheritance — a `Model` base** — a generated type declaring a base (`record User : Model`);
    needs **base-list support** in the emitter, and `Model` becomes the shared base entities inherit.
    Makes the inheritance half of #11 concrete. [before/with M4]
15. **Output target: namespace + folder** [M4] — a type name alone doesn't say *where* the file
    lands or *what namespace* it declares. A **wrapper on the emitted type** (not a change to the
    node model), forced when recipes reference each other across files (a `using` needs a namespace).
16. **`using`-derivation** — ✅ **resolved (probe D).** With the **semantic model**, `ITypeSymbol.ToDisplayString`
    renders either idiomatic (`int`, `List<string>`, `string?`, named tuples) with a **derived `using`
    set** (walk the symbol graph → namespaces) or fully-qualified with none — an *emit setting*, not an
    authoring choice. This replaces the reflection-`FullName` path that forced dropping the alias
    dictionary; the recipe is authored unchanged. (`spike/probe-d-semantic-rendering/`.)
17. **Generated-type representation / `TypeRef`** — ⚠️ **narrowed (probe E).** The earlier claim (a
    generated type "lives in another compilation, so it's `TypeRef` not `<T>`") is **not generally
    true**: a generator-minted type is `public` in the producer's emitted assembly, so it's an ordinary
    `<T>` type **within the same compilation** (order-independent) and **cross-project when the producer
    is referenced**. Name-based `TypeRef` is genuinely required **only at the unresolved-producer
    boundary** — an unbuilt/unreferenced or circular producer (`CS0246`). Keep `TypeRef` for exactly
    that corner; everywhere else `<T>` works. (`spike/probe-e-forward-ref/`.)
18. **Members beyond fields; modifiers; base/interface lists** — *methods done* (`MethodNode`, body =
    body tier, via the `Member` base). Remaining: **method params wired to body handles** (next
    sub-step), ctors/properties, access modifiers (`static`/`public`), base + interface lists.
19. **Enum underlying type + explicit values** — `enum X : byte { A = 1 }`. The current `EnumNode`
    carries bare names only.

## 9. Open questions / risks

- **`@`-marker discovery robustness** — scanning parsed identifier nodes for `@`
  is clean, but verify it never collides with a legitimately-escaped keyword
  identifier the author actually wants literal.
- **Inline limits** — inlining is safe for single-expression / simple bodies;
  multi-statement snippets with locals need `Call` (Step-2+). Don't over-reach.
- **Cross-snippet scope** — snippets compile in isolation, but a recipe can still
  wire an out-of-scope name; that error only surfaces at the composition gate
  (§4.6). Acceptable, but the error message quality matters for agent-first.
- **Name wiring is stringly-typed** for now (`"acc"`, `"i"`). Backlog #1 addresses
  this; until then, recipe authors must keep names consistent by hand.
