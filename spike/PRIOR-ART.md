## TL;DR

**No surveyed tool occupies the spike's exact combination of all four axes:**

| Axis | What the spike does |
|---|---|
| **Data-driven recipe** | composition is *data* — a typed-record tree whose node schema is **source-generated from the snippets**, so it can't drift; the type system *is* the schema |
| **Parse-and-substitute real source** | Roslyn parses real, isolately-compiling C# snippet bodies and substitutes holes at the **leaf** level — never hand-builds syntax trees |
| **Owned artifact** | output is a plain, readable, hand-editable `.cs` you commit — not compiler-woven, not an opaque AST, not editor-resident |
| **Agent-first** | an LLM authors the recipe; the C# type checker validates the composition **for free** |

The nearest neighbors each share **some** axes and diverge on others. They cluster
into three camps plus one outlier — detailed below.

## The field, in one table

| Camp | Exemplars | Shares with the spike | Diverges on |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Compile-time metaprogramming** | Metalama, Roslyn Source Generators | real-C#-as-template, staged type-safety | output is **compiler-woven / compiler-managed**, not an owned editable `.cs`; boundary drawn by `meta`-marker, not a data recipe |
| **Staged / quasiquote metaprogramming** | MetaOCaml, Scala 3 quotes-and-splices, Squid | "a well-typed generator generates only well-typed code" — the staged form of compile-or-fail | composes **opaque typed ASTs** via in-language quote/splice combinators (not a data recipe); never emits readable source |
| **Typed holes / projectional editing** | Hazel, Hazelnut, ChatLSP | the **"fill the typed hole"** framing; by-construction safety; (ChatLSP) agent-first | a structure editor over **their own** functional language; context-injection + post-hoc LSP feedback, not deterministic parse-and-substitute into C# |
| **Type-constrained decoding** (outlier) | ETH Zurich type-constrained generation (PLDI 2025) | "the type system **is** the constraint; illegal output can't be produced," deterministic | constrains **token decoding**, not the lowering of a typed-record recipe |

---

## Camp 1 — C#/.NET compile-time metaprogramming

### Metalama — the closest .NET-native relative
**What it is.** A Roslyn-based metaprogramming framework (code generation, AOP,
architecture verification). Its T# templates are single C# methods that mix
compile-time and run-time code; compile-time logic (marked by the `meta`
pseudo-keyword, recognized via `CompileTimeAttribute`) runs in the compiler/IDE to
generate the C# that ships.

**How close.** Shares the spike's **"the template is a real, compiling C# method
body"** insight, and its staged type-safety. But it draws the template/hole
boundary with a `meta` marker rather than typed holes in a *data* recipe, and —
decisively — it **"seamlessly merges the aspect template with your business code …
on the fly"**: templates compile to an embedded resource and apply as
transformations into a new compilation. That is the **inverse** of the spike's
owned/readable/editable `.cs`. (Escape hatches — `AspectDiff` preview, and "Divorce"
to permanently inject the generated code into source and drop the Metalama
dependency — exist but aren't the default.)

> [template overview](https://doc.metalama.net/conceptual/aspects/templates/template-overview),
> [pipeline](https://doc.metalama.net/conceptual/implementation/pipeline).

### Roslyn Source Generators — closest mainstream mechanism
**What it is.** Generators emit strings of C# **added** to the compilation via
`AddSource()`, surfaced as syntax trees the user references as if already present.

**How close.** The spike's *recipe-nodes-source-generated-from-snippets* step is a
**textbook** Source Generator use. But the cookbook frames generators as
**"explicitly additive only,"** and generated code is compiler-managed
(`// <auto-generated />`, not emitted to disk by default) — **not** an owned,
hand-editable artifact. The novelty isn't "we use a generator"; it's *what* is
generated (a typed recipe schema) plus a **separate parse-and-substitute render
step** that yields owned source.

> explicitly *not* `SyntaxFactory` tree-building. That's the same "don't hand-build
> trees" instinct as the spike's §6, reached from the production side.

---

## Camp 2 — staged / quasiquote metaprogramming

This camp **delivers the spike's headline type guarantee** — *a well-typed
generator can only produce well-typed, well-scoped code* — but does it inside the
language, over opaque code values, and never emits readable source.

| System | The guarantee | Why it isn't the spike |
|---|---|---|
| **MetaOCaml** | brackets `.<e>.` quote a code value, `.~e` splices; **"a well-typed MetaOCaml program generates only well-typed programs"** (scope-extrusion check) | composition is in-language combinators; the composed object is an opaque code value, not a data recipe or readable `.cs` |
| **Scala 3 quotes-and-splices** (Stucki/Biboudis/Odersky, GPCE'18) | `'{e}: Expr[T]`, `'[T]: Type[T]`; **"type-safe in a modular way — typechecking the generator ensures the validity of the generated code"** (Phase Consistency Principle) | typed AST values composed via quote/splice; no source-generated record schema; no owned source |
| **Squid** (Parreaux et al., Scala/GPCE'17) | statically-typed, hygienic quasiquotes; fragments stay **well-scoped and well-typed** at compile time | builds/composes **ASTs/IR**, not parse-and-substitute of real source text; output is an IR, not a `.cs` |

So the staged camp matches the spike on the *guarantee* but differs on **two axes**
at once: composition is expressed **in program code via combinators** (not a
source-generated typed-record recipe **tree as data**), and the composed object is
an **opaque code value/IR**, not an owned, readable artifact.

## Camp 3 — typed holes, projectional editing, and LLM-with-holes

This camp owns the **"fill the typed hole"** framing the spike borrows — and
includes the **single most agent-first relative** found.

### Hazel / Hazelnut — typed holes as first-class, by construction
**What it is.** Hazel is organized around typed-hole-driven development: holes both
(1) stand for missing parts and (2) act as **membranes around erroneous parts**, so
**incomplete programs can be typechecked, manipulated, and run**. Hazelnut (POPL
2017) is a bidirectionally-typed **structure (projectional) editor calculus** —
you edit the program **tree** directly, malformed text is impossible by
construction, every edit state is type-checkable (mechanized in Agda), and
type-inconsistent terms are auto-wrapped in a hole.

**How close.** Conceptual sibling of the spike's `Slot`/body holes — but the
substrate is a **projectional editor over Hazel's own functional language**, not
Roslyn parse-and-substitute of real C#, and there is **no data-driven typed-record
recipe**.

> Verified 3-0 (unanimous across 4 merged claims). Sources:
> [hazel.org](https://hazel.org/),
> [Hazelnut (POPL'17)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.08694),
> [live holes](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.04180).

### ChatLSP — "Statically Contextualizing LLMs with Typed Holes" (OOPSLA 2024)
**What it is.** Uses the Hazel language server to resolve the **type and typing
context of the hole being filled** (even amid errors, via total type-error
localization), serializes that into the LLM prompt, and **post-hoc refines** raw
completions through up to two rounds of dialog with the language server.

**How close — the sharpest contrast.** It shares the spike's **typed-hole +
agent-first** framing, but differs on **every deterministic axis**: it
**injects** the hole's type into the prompt and **post-hoc validates** free-form
completions ("reply only with code"), rather than having the LLM emit a typed
record/IR that is **deterministically lowered** and validated by the compiler. It
is the spike's nearest agent-first relative and its clearest foil on "deterministic,
schema-validated, owned artifact."

> **Also in this camp (uncovered, see caveats):** JetBrains MPS — a projectional
> language workbench editing programs as an AST directly. "Code as structured data,"
> the opposite of the spike's choice to keep **real, hand-editable source text**.

---

## Camp 4 (outlier) — type-constrained decoding

**Type-Constrained Code Generation with Language Models** (Mündler et al., ETH
Zurich SRI Lab, PLDI 2025) introduces **prefix automata + a search over
inhabitable types** — "a sound approach to enforce well-typedness on LLM-generated
code," formalized on a simply-typed language and extended to TypeScript.

**How close — closest on the thesis, different layer.** Like the spike, **the type
system is the constraint** and the guarantee is **deterministic / by-construction**,
not post-hoc. But it acts at **token-decode time** over raw token sequences,
whereas the spike lifts the constraint to a **source-generated typed-record recipe
schema** (illegal compositions fail to compile) plus deterministic leaf-level
parse-and-substitute. Same goal ("type system as schema"), different layer.

## Closest prior art — the shortlist

Ranked by how many of the spike's four axes each shares:

1. **Metalama** — real-C#-as-template + staged type-safety. Misses *data recipe*
   and *owned artifact* (woven output).
2. **ChatLSP** — agent-first + typed holes. Misses *determinism* and *schema-as-IR*
   (prompt-injection + post-hoc LSP feedback).
3. **Scala 3 quotes-and-splices / MetaOCaml / Squid** — the staged type guarantee,
   exactly. Miss *data recipe* and *readable source* (opaque ASTs, in-language
   combinators).
4. **ETH type-constrained decoding** — "type system is the constraint,"
   deterministic. Misses *typed-record recipe* and *owned-artifact* framing
   (token-level).
5. **Roslyn Source Generators** — the substrate the spike's node-gen sits on. Misses
   *owned artifact* and a *parse-and-substitute render step* on its own.

---

## White space — what looks genuinely unoccupied

The intersection the spike targets appears **unfilled** in the gathered evidence:

> **A source-generated typed-record recipe** — the LLM authors a tree whose node
> schema is *derived from the snippet catalog*, so the C# type checker validates
> the composition **for free** — **lowered by leaf-level parse-and-substitute of
> real, isolately-compiling snippets into an owned, hand-editable `.cs`.**

Each neighbor satisfies a **subset**; none satisfies all four cells
(data-recipe + parse-and-substitute-real-source + owned-artifact + agent-first).

**Confidence: medium.** This is a *synthesis inference* from unanimous per-tool
contrasts, **not** a single source asserting "nobody has done X." It could be
displaced by an uncovered tool — most plausibly a **commercial "agent composes from
a vetted component catalog" product**, of which **none surfaced** in verified
claims.

---

## Coverage gaps (be honest about what wasn't verified)

Named in the brief but **not** reached by a surviving verified claim — treat as
**gaps, not absences of prior art**, and the first targets for a follow-up pass:

- **C#/.NET templating:** T4, CodeDOM, Scriban/Razor, "Bricks", partial-method
  generators *(only Metalama + Source Generators verified)*.
- **Macro/quasiquote lineage:** Template Haskell (typed `[|| ||]` / `TExpQ`),
  Lisp/Racket hygienic macros, MacroML *(only MetaOCaml, Scala 3 quotes, Squid
  verified — Template Haskell is the most conspicuous omission)*.
- **Projectional editing:** JetBrains MPS, Lava *(only Hazel/Hazelnut verified)*.
- **Program synthesis:** Sketch, component-based synthesis, GHC typed holes, Agda
  *(only the Hazel family + type-constrained decoding verified)*.
- **LLM constrained generation:** Microsoft Guidance, Outlines, grammar-constrained
  decoding broadly *(only ETH's type-constrained decoding verified)*.

### Open questions worth a second pass
1. Does any **agent-first product** already have an LLM compose code from a **vetted
   snippet/component catalog into owned source**? (Highest-value unexplored target —
   none surfaced.)
2. How does **Template Haskell** (typed quotes) compare on the staged-safety axis,
   and do any TH libraries expose a **data-driven recipe** rather than in-language
   splicing?
3. Across **program synthesis** (Sketch, component-based, type-directed), does any
   emit an **owned, readable artifact** rather than an internal solver result — i.e.
   is "owned hand-editable output" unoccupied across synthesis too?
4. Do **JetBrains MPS** or other projectional editors support a textual-projection
   mode that yields **owned editable source from a typed tree** — partially
   overlapping the spike's recipe-to-source pipeline?

## Method & provenance

5 search angles (C#/.NET metaprogramming · quasiquote/staged · program
synthesis/typed-holes · projectional editing/code-as-data · LLM constrained
generation) → 20 sources fetched → 91 falsifiable claims extracted → top 25
adversarially verified (3-vote, 2/3-refute kills) → **24 confirmed, 1 killed** →
synthesized to 7 findings. Sources are uniformly primary (vendor docs or
peer-reviewed venues — POPL, PLDI, OOPSLA, GPCE, Scala Symposium) and current
(2016–2026). One ACM PDF (Squid) returned 403 but was corroborated by the project's
official docs. The positive novelty claim is the one **medium-confidence** finding;
everything else is high-confidence with a unanimous or near-unanimous vote.

## TL;DR of the node-based lens

The export-code tools split into "owns the code" vs "owns the model" — but **none**
of them (a) **parse-and-substitute real source fragments** per node, or (b)
**source-generate their node schema from a vetted snippet catalog**. Across the
surveyed node/low-code tools that's **0-for-N** — though note both moves *do* exist
outside this set (Rust `parse_quote!`; fluent-builder generators), so the real
novelty is the **combination**, not either move alone (see below).

## Export-code vs. interpret-graph — the classification

| Tool | Export or interpret | Exports (lang) | Owned / round-trip? | Typed ports? | Per-node codegen |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Blockly** | **export** | JS / Python / Dart / Lua / PHP | owned string, **one-way** | weak — string-set intersection | **string concat** templates |
| **Simulink + Embedded Coder** | **export** | C / C++ / HDL | readable, but **model is owned** (regenerated) | yes (typed block ports) | **TLC target-file templates** from `model.rtw` |
| **OutSystems** | **export** ("detach") | .NET / C# | owned, **one-way, all-or-nothing** | yes (typed model) | compiler / AST backend |
| **Plasmic** | **export** | React / TypeScript | owned **+ resync** (owned-wrapper seam) | typed visual model | codegen from visual model |
| **FlutterFlow** | **export** | Dart / Flutter | owned **+ round-trip** (scoped to custom code) | typed widgets | widget-tree emission |
| **Unreal Blueprint Nativization** | export → **throwaway** | C++ | **not owned/readable**, one-way, **deprecated (UE5)** | yes (typed pins) | AST → C++ backend |
| **Bubble** | **interpret** | — (`.bubble` JSON config, non-executable) | none | n/a | n/a (runtime engine) |

The spike sits off the right edge of this table: **owned C#**, schema **= the host
type system**, renderer **= parse-and-substitute of real fragments**.

## What the node tools teach us (per finding)

- **Blockly** — the archetypal block→code generator. Each block has a per-language
  generator function that **returns a string by concatenation**
  (`left + ' ' + op + ' ' + right`). This is the *opposite* of the spike's renderer,
  and confirms string-templating is the default in this world. Its "type checks" are
  a **nullable array of strings**, compatible iff they share ≥1 string (null =
  wildcard) — connect-time validation, but **not a type system**. The spike pushes
  validation into the C# compiler; strictly stronger. *(3-0; one over-broad
  "compatible types" sibling refuted 1-2.)*
- **Simulink / Stateflow + Embedded Coder** — a *real* export-code, model-based tool
  generating **readable C/C++** from a typed block diagram. But generation is
  **TLC template/target-file emission** over the `model.rtw` IR, and the **model,
  not the `.c`, is the owned artifact** — code is regenerated-from-model, not
  hand-owned. Architecturally opposite to parse-and-substitute. *(3-0.)*
- **Unreal Blueprint Nativization** — converted typed-pin graphs to C++, but output
  was build-pipeline throwaway ("**not formatted to be reusable or reader
  friendly**", in `Intermediate/`), one-way, and **removed in UE5**. Typed graph,
  but fails the owned/readable filter entirely — historical prior art, not a
  shipping capability. *(3-0.)*
- **Plasmic** — **closest on owned + round-trip**: codegen writes React/TS **into
  your git repo** (`git commit` the output) with a two-file split — Plasmic-owned
  presentation files (overwritten on sync) + **developer-owned wrappers** that
  hand-edits survive in. Shares owned-source + resync; diverges on renderer
  (codegen, not parse-and-substitute) and schema (visual model, not from a snippet
  catalog). *(3-0.)*
- **FlutterFlow** — **closest on genuine round-trip**: a VS Code extension pushes
  local edits up and pulls changes down, yielding real owned Dart. But round-trip is
  **scoped to custom-code resources**, not the whole visual app (the "entire
  codebase" claim was **refuted 0-3**), and pull overwrites uncommitted edits.
  *(3-0.)*
- **OutSystems** — customers can **detach and own** generated .NET/C#. Real, but
  **one-way, all-or-nothing, support-gated** ("changes to the detached source are
  not supported"). Three over-broad siblings (no proprietary runtime; clean
  hand-edit/VCS) were **refuted 0-3** — "owned" here is cumbersome and one-way.
  *(3-0.)*
- **Bubble** — the opposite pole: **pure locked runtime**, "**no way of exporting
  your application as code**"; the JSON export is config, not source. *(3-0.)*

## Closest prior art (node-based shortlist)

Ranked by how many spike axes each shares (owned source · round-trip · typed graph ·
parse-and-substitute · schema-from-catalog):

1. **Plasmic** — owned + resync + typed visual model. Misses parse-and-substitute &
   schema-from-snippets.
2. **FlutterFlow** — owned + round-trip (scoped) + typed widgets. Same two misses.
3. **Simulink + Embedded Coder** — typed ports + readable export, but model-owned &
   template-emitted.
4. **OutSystems** — owned C# (one-way) + typed model, compiler-emitted.
5. **Blockly** — the reference block→code generator; weak types, string-concat.

## The renderer axis — no *node-based* tool parses-and-substitutes

The spike's renderer move is: **parse a real, isolately-compiling snippet body
with Roslyn and substitute typed holes at the leaf** — never build trees, never
string-concat. Across the verified node-based set:

| Renderer style | Tools |
|---|---|
| String / template concat | Blockly |
| Target-file / TLC template from an IR | Simulink Embedded Coder |
| AST / compiler backend | Blueprint Nativization, OutSystems |
| Codegen from a visual model | Plasmic, FlutterFlow |
| **Parse real fragments + substitute holes** | **none (of the node-based set)** |

And on **schema origin**: every node-based tool's schema comes from a **visual model
or block registry** — none source-generate it from a catalog of real annotated
methods.

> **⚠️ Scope this claim correctly — see "The moves are not individually
> unprecedented" below.** Parse-and-substitute and schema-from-catalog each *do*
> exist outside the node-based world (Rust `parse_quote!`; source-generated fluent
> builders). What no surveyed tool does is **combine** them — with each other, with
> an owned `.cs`, and with agent-first authoring.

## The moves are not individually unprecedented — the novelty is the *combination*

The earlier passes framed the two renderer/schema moves as "0-for-N." That is only
true **within the node/low-code set** and only as a *combination*. As individual
techniques, both are known — naming the precedents keeps us honest:

| "Distinctive" move | Already exists as | So the move alone is… |
|---|---|---|
| Parse a real fragment + substitute typed holes | Rust **`syn::parse_quote!`** (parse valid Rust, interpolate hygiene-checked `#holes`) — the idiomatic alternative to hand-building `syn` trees; Template Haskell typed quotes are adjacent | **precedented** (different substrate: proc-macro, compiler-resident output — not an owned `.cs`) |
| Source-generate the authoring schema from an annotated catalog | **M31.FluentAPI**, **BuilderGenerator** — Roslyn generators that emit a typed, drift-free, IntelliSense-backed builder API from annotations | **precedented** (the *mechanism*; the spike's novelty is the *payload* — a recipe of code fragments) |
| Emit owned, git-committed, hand-editable source from a declarative recipe | **Hygen / Plop / Yeoman** scaffolders (frontmatter + EJS body + variable substitution, source-controlled in your repo) | **precedented** (but string/EJS templating, no type-system schema, no parse-of-real-source) |

**What stays genuinely unoccupied is their conjunction** — and the load-bearing
axis is **agent-first**: an LLM authoring a typed-record recipe whose schema is
source-generated from a vetted snippet catalog, lowered by parse-and-substitute of
real snippets into an owned `.cs`, with the type checker validating for free. No
surveyed tool occupies that intersection; `parse_quote!` and FluentAPI-generators
each take one cell, scaffolders take the owned-artifact cell, but none take all of
them at once.

> Near-miss sources (added in review): Rust [`syn`/`quote`/`parse_quote!`](https://docs.rs/syn/latest/syn/macro.parse_quote.html),

## White space (node-based)

> No surveyed tool occupies the spike's exact combination. **Owned + round-trip +
> typed-ish graph** is approximated (Plasmic, FlutterFlow, Rete Studio) and **owned
> one-way** exists (OutSystems, Embedded Coder); the renderer move exists in Rust

## Coverage gaps (node-based) — be honest

Named in the brief but **no surviving verified claim** — classification **open**,
not established:

- **Visual scripting / blocks:** Scratch/Snap!, Unity Visual Scripting (Bolt).
- **Design-to-code:** Webflow, Anima, Locofy, Builder.io, Framer *(only Plasmic &
  FlutterFlow verified)*.
- **Enterprise low-code:** Mendix *(SDK claim refuted 0-3)*, Retool.
- **Flow automation:** Node-RED, n8n, Make, Zapier.
- **Dataflow / model:** LabVIEW, Grasshopper, Dynamo, TouchDesigner, Max/MSP, vvvv,
  Houdini.
- **Data-science node editors:** KNIME, Orange.
- **Node-graph libraries (substrate):** Rete.js, LiteGraph.js, React Flow, Drawflow,
  Cables.gl — *do any ship a code-**emit** backend, not just graph-run?* Unverified.

**The highest-value gap (both passes agree):** an **AI/agent product where an LLM
builds a *typed node graph* that is then lowered to *owned real code*** (LLM → typed
graph → owned source, not LLM → raw code). **Zero verified evidence** in either
survey — the spike's agent-first white space is inferred from *absence*, and a
dedicated search is the obvious next step.

> **Method (addendum):** 6 angles → 25 sources → 108 claims → 25 verified (3-vote,
> 2/3-refute) → **20 confirmed / 5 killed** → 9 findings. Sources primary (vendor
> docs: Blockly, MathWorks, Unreal, Plasmic, FlutterFlow, OutSystems, Bubble).
> Caveat: "readable" in vendor copy (Embedded Coder) is marketing, not proof of
> hand-editable ownership; Blueprint Nativization docs are UE4.x (removed in UE5).

## The standout: a node library that *does* emit code — and round-trips

**Rete.js** is the one graph library that ships a real **code-emit backend**, not
just a graph-run engine:

- Its **`code-plugin`** lowers a Rete graph to source —
  `CodePlugin.generate(engine, editor.toJSON())` → plain **JavaScript** — via
  **template/string emission** (3-0).
- **Rete Studio** goes further: **round-trip** — *"transform a textual programming
  language into a visual representation, which can then be transformed back into
  textual language"* (3-0). Input JS → graph → JS.

So a node library *can* emit owned code and even round-trip it — but still by
**string templating**, in JS, with no typed-record schema generated from a vetted
catalog. It's the closest *library*, and it confirms the renderer pattern rather
than breaking it.

The other libraries are **interpret-graph**: **LiteGraph.js** exports JSON for a
runtime and *"has no code-emission"* (per-node behavior = registered JS functions);
**Flume** is *"a React node editor paired with a runtime engine, not a code
generator"*; **React Flow (xyflow)** is *"a UI rendering library … not a
code-generation tool"* (all 3-0).

## Classification — the gap tools

| Tool | Export or interpret | Exports (lang) | Owned / round-trip? | Per-node codegen |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Rete.js** (code-plugin / Rete Studio) | **export** | JavaScript | owned; **round-trip** (Rete Studio) | string/template |
| **Builder.io Visual Copilot** | **export** | React/Vue/Angular/Svelte/Qwik/Solid/HTML/Flutter… | owned (PR/local), one-way | AI model + **Mitosis** transpiler |
| **Mitosis** | **export** (transpiler) | many frameworks from JSX | owned | compile/transpile |
| **TeleportHQ** | **export** | React/Vue/Next/Angular/HTML | owned, **dependency-free** | template/codegen |
| **Dynamo** (Code Block) | partial graph→text | DesignScript | text bridge (not full-fidelity¹) | node→DesignScript |
| **Grasshopper** (C# Script) | **interpret** (+ embedded code) | C# you hand-write in a node | exportable to external file | compiled & run at runtime |
| **LiteGraph.js / Flume / React Flow** | **interpret** | — (JSON / UI) | none | runtime / rendering |
| **Mendix** (SDK "codegen") | **interpret** | TS that **rebuilds the model**² | model is the deployable, not owned source | model serialization |
| **Framer** | **interpret** (hosted) | — *"does not support direct code export"* | none | n/a |
| **LangFlow** | **interpret** | JSON (standalone `.py` is an open feature request) | none | runtime |

¹ "one Code Block = the whole graph" full-fidelity claim **refuted 1-2**.
² Mendix-generates-owned-Java-from-microflows claim **refuted 1-2** — the SDK emits
a script that *reconstructs the model*, not owned app source. (Note: the first
node-based pass refuted a *different* Mendix sub-claim 0-3 — the SDK-to-Java
conversion-path framing — so the same tool carries two distinct refutations across
passes; they are not contradictory.)

## The agent-first axis — from "zero evidence" to two named near-misses

Both prior passes left this as inferred-from-absence. This pass found the two
closest things that exist — and **neither closes the spike's full combo**:

- **`flowise-to-langchain`** (community tool) — **EXPORT-CODE**: statically converts
  **Flowise** visual LLM flows (JSON graphs) into *"standalone, executable LangChain
  code"* — owned, hand-editable, **TypeScript and Python**, organized around
  per-language `emitters/` (3-0). *Closest confirmed "node graph → owned code" in
  the agent space.* **But:** it converts **pre-existing human-built** flows (not
  LLM-authored), it's **one-way**, the schema isn't source-generated from a vetted
  snippet catalog, and the emitter method (template vs. AST vs. parse-and-substitute)
  is **unspecified** in the docs.
- **Agint** (research, *agentic graph compiler*) — an LLM that *"converts
  natural-language instructions into **typed, effect-aware code DAGs**"* with
  explicit **"type floors" (text → data → spec → code)** (3-0). *Closest on the
  LLM → typed-graph idea found anywhere across all three passes.* **But:** it is a
  *"compiler, interpreter, and runtime"* with a **hybrid LLM/JIT runtime that
  executes the DAG** — **interpret-graph, not owned-source emission** — and evidence
  that invalid graphs *statically* fail to compile is thin.

**Verdict:** the agent-first white space **narrows but holds.** You can now get
*LLM → typed graph* (Agint) **or** *node graph → owned code* (flowise-to-langchain)
— but **no tool combines them** into *LLM authors a typed graph whose schema is
generated from a vetted catalog → lowered into owned source*.

## Updated scorecard (all three passes)

The two renderer/schema rows read "no" **within the surveyed set, and as a
combination** — both moves exist as individual techniques elsewhere (see *"The moves
are not individually unprecedented"* in the node-based section: Rust `parse_quote!`,
fluent-builder generators). The honest claim is occupancy *of the conjunction*, not
unprecedented moves.

| Spike axis | Occupied by any surveyed tool? |
|---|---|
| Deterministic graph → code | yes (many) |
| Owned, hand-editable artifact | yes (Plasmic, FlutterFlow, Rete Studio, Builder.io, TeleportHQ, OutSystems; **also scaffolders** Hygen/Plop/Yeoman) |
| Round-trip code↔graph | yes (Rete Studio; partial FlutterFlow/Plasmic) |
| Typed node graph (real type system, not string-match) | **partial** (typed pins exist; none use the *host language's* type checker as the schema) |
| Renderer = parse real fragments + substitute holes | **none in the surveyed set** — but precedented elsewhere (Rust `parse_quote!`); not into an owned `.cs` |
| Schema source-generated from a vetted catalog | **none in the surveyed set** — but the *mechanism* exists (M31.FluentAPI / BuilderGenerator); novelty is the fragment-catalog payload |
| **Agent-first (LLM authors the graph)** | **near-misses only** (Agint types it but interprets; flowise emits but is human-authored) — the genuinely near-empty axis |

The spike's defensible, unoccupied ground is the **conjunction** of these rows —
above all the agent-first axis, where the field is genuinely near-empty.

## Remaining gaps (still thin)

- **Cables.js, Drawflow, Nodes.io** node libraries — not reached; classification
  open.
- **Locofy** — source returned unreliable (no verified claim); **Webflow code
  export, Anima** — not separately verified this pass.
- **Scratch/Snap!, Unity Bolt, Node-RED/n8n/Make/Zapier, LabVIEW C Generator,
  Houdini/TouchDesigner/Max/vvvv, KNIME/Orange** — still unverified; treat
  export-vs-interpret as open.
- **Agint** is a single research source; its "typed/effect-aware" guarantees aren't
  independently corroborated here.

> **Method (addendum II):** 5 angles → 22 sources → 81 claims → 25 verified (3-vote)
> → **23 confirmed / 2 killed**. Reconstructed from the verified claim set (the
> run's synthesis step produced a stub). Sources primary where it matters (Rete.js
> GitHub/docs, LiteGraph, Mendix apidocs, Dynamo primer, Builder.io); some
> design-to-code and agent-first sources are blog/secondary and flagged thin.

# Appendix A: what they actually look like

Verbatim node→file examples from the closest neighbors, so the comparison is
concrete rather than abstract. (One flowise sample is *representative*, flagged
below — its README shows wrapper patterns, not a golden node→code output.)

### Rete.js `code-plugin` — graph node → JS file
The node *owns the code it emits*; the plugin walks the graph and threads each
node's rendered input handles into the next.

```javascript
class NumComponent extends Rete.Component {
    code(node, inputs, add) {
        add('console.log("hello!")')
        add('num', node.data.num);
    }
}
const sourceCode = await CodePlugin.generate(engine, editor.toJSON());
```
Emitted file (two Number nodes 5 & 6 → Add nodes) — note the **auto-derived
names**, not hand-written strings:
```javascript
console.log("hello!");
const number1num = 5;
console.log("hello!");
const number3num = 6;
const add4num = number3num + number1num;
const add2num = add4num + number1num;
```
→ `github.com/retejs/code-plugin`, `github.com/retejs/rete-studio` (round-trips
text↔graph↔text).

### Mitosis — one component IR → many real files
```jsx
export default function Greet() {
  const state = useStore({ name: "" });
  return (<div>
    <input value={state.name}
      onChange={(e) => state.name = e.target.value} placeholder="Your name" />
    <div>Hello, {state.name}!</div>
  </div>);
}
```
Emitted React (Svelte/Vue/Angular/Qwik/Solid from the same source):
```jsx
function Greet(props: any) {
  const [name, setName] = useState(() => "");
  return (<div>
    <input placeholder="Your name" value={name}
      onChange={(e) => setName(e.target.value)} />
    <div>Hello, {name}!</div>
  </div>);
}
```
→ `builder.io/blog/mitosis-get-started` (the engine under Builder.io Visual Copilot).

### flowise-to-langchain — Flowise JSON graph → LangChain code
```bash
npm run start -- convert my-flow.json output
npm run start -- convert my-flow.json output --target python --with-monitoring
```
`src/converters/` (130+ per-node-type) → `src/emitters/` (TS / Python).
*Representative* emitted TS (not a verbatim golden output):
```typescript
export async function runFlow(input: string): Promise<string> {
  const tracker = performanceMonitor.track('workflow.execution');
  try {
    const result = await agent.call({ input });
    tracker.measure('execution_time');
    return result;
  } finally { performanceMonitor.recordSnapshot(tracker.end()); }
}
```
→ `github.com/iaminawe/flowise-to-langchain`.

### Simulink + Embedded Coder — typed block → C file
Verbatim generated step function (discrete state-space), MathWorks Dec 2025:
```c
void testCG_step(void)
{
  testCG_Y.y = testCG_P.C * testCG_DW.UnitDelay_DSTATE +
               testCG_P.D * testCG_U.u;
  testCG_DW.UnitDelay_DSTATE = testCG_P.A *
                               testCG_DW.UnitDelay_DSTATE +
                               testCG_P.B * testCG_U.u;
}
```
"One line of code per block," emitted by `.tlc` templates over a `model.rtw` IR.
→ `blogs.mathworks.com/simulink/2025/12/29/...`.

### Plasmic — the two-file owned seam
Tool-owned blackbox `plasmic/PlasmicButton.tsx` (overwritten each sync) +
developer-owned wrapper `Button.tsx` (never touched by regen):
```typescript
import { PlasmicButton, DefaultButtonProps } from './plasmic/PlasmicButton';
interface ButtonProps extends DefaultButtonProps {}
function Button(props: ButtonProps) { return <PlasmicButton {...props} />; }
export default Button;
```
→ `docs.plasmic.app/learn/codegen-components/`.

### FlutterFlow — owned Dart project, scoped round-trip
```
lib/custom_code/actions/        ← one file per action
lib/custom_code/widgets/        ← one file per widget
lib/flutter_flow/custom_functions.dart
```
Round-trip via VS Code: `Download Code` · `Start Code Editing Session` ·
`Push to FlutterFlow` · `Pull Latest Changes` — scoped to custom-code resources,
not the whole visual app. → `docs.flutterflow.io/concepts/custom-code/vscode-extension/`.

### Mapping back to the spike
| Tool | "Node" is | Emits | Renderer |
|---|---|---|---|
| Rete code-plugin | graph node w/ `code()` | JS file | `add(...)` string-emit |
| Mitosis | JSX/Lite IR | N framework files | transpile IR |
| flowise→langchain | Flowise JSON graph | LangChain TS/Py | per-lang emitters |
| Embedded Coder | typed block | C file | `.tlc` templates |
| Plasmic | visual design | React (2-file) | codegen |
| **spike** | **typed record / `[Snippet]`** | **`.cs`** | **parse real source + substitute holes** |

# Appendix B: learnings to extract for our style

Not survey — design pressure on the spike itself. (Cross-refs are to README §8
backlog items.) **Priority order revised after a review pass** — see *"Acting on
this"* at the end; B1–B6 are kept distinct so each learning stays tracked.

### B1. Replace stringly-typed name-wiring with an identity-carrying binding — **do this**
Rete's emitted `number1num` / `add4num` are minted from node identity, and each node
receives its inputs' *already-rendered handles* — variables align because the
renderer threads handles through the graph, **not** because a human spelled two
strings the same.

Our `loop+var+sum` recipe still wires by hand-matched strings
(`Define(Var:"acc")` … `Assign(Target:"acc")` … `Ref("acc")`). That's **backlog
#1** *and* a silent-bug class (a typo'd `"acc "` compiles to a second variable;
confirmed in `Generator.BuildHoles`, which routes every `string` into the name-holes
and substitutes by literal text).

**The fix is *not* Rete's literal move.** Auto-minting opaque names like
`define1var` would make the owned `.cs` **less** readable — fighting the spike's
core "owned, hand-editable" constraint. The right form (and what README #1 already
says — `.Named("acc")`) is a **binding object**: a `Define` mints a binding that
downstream nodes reference **by identity**, while the human still chooses the
displayed name. That kills the string-matching *and* keeps the output legible.
**Highest-value, lowest-risk steal — once scoped to a binding, not auto-naming.**

### B2. The owned seam (Plasmic / FlutterFlow) — **decide before the spike grows a hand-edit story**
Plasmic never lets you edit the generated blackbox; hand-edits live in a thin
wrapper regen **never touches**. FlutterFlow confirms the corollary: even they scope
round-trip to a small custom-code surface, never the whole app. The lesson:
**don't make the owned `.cs` both freely regenerable and freely hand-editable —
that's the round-trip tar pit.** A regenerated core + a stable, preserved seam.

This **reframes backlog #4 (`Raw(...)`):** the escape hatch shouldn't be arbitrary
inline code — it should be a **named region the regenerator preserves verbatim**,
i.e. our version of Plasmic's owned wrapper.

### B3. The ownership fork — **make it an explicit decision (ADR-worthy)**
Embedded Coder emits readable C but the **model is owned and the `.c` is
disposable** (regenerated every build). Our README asserts the opposite (owned
`.cs`). These are mutually exclusive once hand-edits exist:

| Stance | Means | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| Recipe is truth (Embedded Coder/Simulink) | regenerate freely; `.cs` is output | no hand-editing the `.cs` |
| `.cs` is truth (OutSystems detach) | generate once, then you own it | regeneration is a fork, not a refresh |

You can only have both via the B2 seam. We're currently asserting "owned `.cs`"
*and* wanting to regenerate — pick one, or build the seam.

### B4. Guard that the renderer can lower every snippet — **do this too (cheapest win)**
flowise *measures* the gap between nodes-that-exist and nodes-it-can-emit ("98.5%
coverage"). Source-gen gives us the node registry for free (no drift), but **nothing
asserts the renderer can actually lower each one** — it's inline-only and
int-specialized (verified: `Generator.RenderStmt` assumes `method.Body!`,
`RenderExpr` assumes `ExpressionBody!`, no generic-`<T>` path), so a snippet can
exist that the tool silently NREs on. For a 5-snippet spike the right mechanism is a
**binary parity guard, not a percentage**: *every `[Snippet]` must round-trip through
the renderer.* This converts the known int-only/inline-only divergences from prose
caveats into **enforced facts** — exactly the repo's enforcement-surface ethos, and
cheaper than B1 (one test, no design change).

### B5. Keep the host type system as the schema (anti-Blockly) — **defensive principle**
The universal weakness across these tools is typing — Blockly's "type check" is
literally string-set intersection. Our differentiator is that **C#'s type checker
*is* the schema.** As we add axes (context variations, `Call` mode), **resist
bolting on a stringly-typed `"kind"` tag to special-case nodes** — that reinvents
Blockly's weakest part and regresses our core claim. (The `gen/Recognizers.cs`
design — one typed recognizer per hole kind — already embodies this: a new axis is a
new typed recognizer, not a `"kind"` tag.) Every new axis stays expressible in the
type system, or it's a regression.

### B6. Resolve scope *at the hole*, agent-first (Hazel / ChatLSP) — **the survey's biggest unspun lesson**
B1 fixes the *name-wiring symptom*; this is the underlying disease. Snippets compile
in isolation, but a recipe can wire an out-of-scope name (`Ref("typo")`) that only
fails at the **final composition gate**, with a poor error message — and README §9
flags "error-message quality matters for agent-first" as a live risk. The entire
**typed-holes camp (Hazel, and especially ChatLSP)** is precisely about resolving
*the typing/binding context of the hole* so the gap is caught **at the hole**, not
post-hoc. Concretely: make `Ref`/`Assign` reference a binding that **must already be
in scope**, so bad wiring fails **at recipe-authoring with a located error**, not at
the final compile. This is the single most spike-relevant learning in the whole
survey, and it's a natural superset of B1 (the binding is the same object).

### Acting on this (revised order, post-review)
1. **B1 — do now**, scoped to an identity-binding (not Rete-style auto-naming): kills
   the only silent-bug class; already backlog #1.
2. **B4 — do now**, cheapest of all: one parity test turns the int-only/inline-only
   divergences into enforced facts.
3. **B6 — high value**: scope-at-the-hole makes bad wiring fail at authoring; the
   binding it needs is the same object B1 introduces, so B1→B6 is one arc.
4. **B2 + B3 — one ADR** ("ownership & the regeneration seam"): they're the same
   decision viewed twice; settle it before the spike grows a hand-edit story.
5. **B5 — standing principle**, no code: a guardrail to honor as new axes land.
