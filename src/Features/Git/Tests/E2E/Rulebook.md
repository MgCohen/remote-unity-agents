## Rules

### chore on a dirty tree → committed and pushed, working copy clean
<!-- id: chore-on-a-dirty-tree-committed-and-pushed-working-copy-clean -->
- **Why:** the non-agent flow path end to end — `GitChoreFlow` stages the dirty tree, commits with the given
  subject, and pushes to the remote, leaving the working copy clean and the remote head at that commit.
