## Rules

### Force push to a protected branch → refused with InvalidOperationException
<!-- id: force-push-to-a-protected-branch-refused-with-invalidoperationexception -->
- **Why:** a force push to main/master can silently destroy shared history, so the guardrail must hard-fail before the dangerous command ever reaches git.

### Commit with an invalid input (no files or blank message) → refused with ArgumentException
<!-- id: commit-with-an-invalid-input-no-files-or-blank-message-refused-with-argumentexception -->
- **Why:** an empty file set or whitespace-only message yields a meaningless or empty commit, so the call must be rejected at the boundary rather than producing junk history.

### Status on a dirty tree → Paths lists each modified and untracked path
<!-- id: status-on-a-dirty-tree-paths-lists-each-modified-and-untracked-path -->
- **Why:** callers decide what to stage/commit from this list, so both already-tracked edits and brand-new files must surface or work silently gets dropped.

### Status → IsDirty reports whether the working tree has uncommitted changes
<!-- id: status-isdirty-reports-whether-the-working-tree-has-uncommitted-changes -->
- **Why:** the dirty flag gates whether a commit step runs at all, so a false negative would skip persisting real work and a false positive would commit nothing.

### Commit of listed files → stages and commits them, returning the full hash and subject and leaving the tree clean
<!-- id: commit-of-listed-files-stages-and-commits-them-returning-the-full-hash-and-subject-and-leaving-the-tree-clean -->
- **Why:** downstream steps key off the returned 40-char hash and subject to reference the commit, and a residual dirty tree would prove the stage didn't actually capture the file.

### Diff on a dirty tree → reports the changed-file count and the diff text naming each file
<!-- id: diff-on-a-dirty-tree-reports-the-changed-file-count-and-the-diff-text-naming-each-file -->
- **Why:** the diff is what gets shown to the model/user for review, so the count and per-file text must reflect the real edits, not a stale or empty snapshot.

### Status after a reverting checkout → reports a clean tree
<!-- id: status-after-a-reverting-checkout-reports-a-clean-tree -->
- **Why:** a revert that still showed phantom changes would trigger needless commits and mislead the dirty check, so state must reset to truly clean.

### Force push to a remote that advanced since the last fetch → refused before it can overwrite
<!-- id: force-push-to-a-remote-that-advanced-since-the-last-fetch-refused-before-it-can-overwrite -->
- **Why:** the cascade force-pushes rebased branches; `--force-with-lease --force-if-includes` must reject a stale overwrite so a collaborator's pushed work is never silently lost (a lease alone is defeated by a background fetch — spike research/stacked-prs.md §9).
