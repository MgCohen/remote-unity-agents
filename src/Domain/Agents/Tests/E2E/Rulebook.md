## Rules

### claude-ping with a scripted reply → implementer reaches Completed
<!-- id: claude-ping-with-a-scripted-reply-implementer-reaches-completed -->
- **Why:** proves the API-down backbone — real composition, Flow engine, snapshot stream, resolver wiring —
  carries an agent flow to a Completed terminal with only the provider's mouth scripted. The deterministic
  counterpart to the live `claude-ping` smoke.
