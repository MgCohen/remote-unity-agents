## Rules

### a ping flow with a trivial prompt → the agent replies and the run completes
<!-- id: b1 -->
- **Why:** the simplest real-CLI proof — a live `claude`/`codex` session drives a ping flow to a Completed
  terminal carrying the agent's own reply, which no scripted provider can establish.

### an autonomous agent given an under-specified prompt → self-resolves and completes without Needs input
<!-- id: b2 -->
- **Why:** an Autonomous role must drive its own blocking question through the auto-resolver and reach
  Completed, never stalling on "Needs input:" — the live proof of the autonomy resume loop.

### an agent given a file request → writes the file into the project on disk
<!-- id: b3 -->
- **Why:** only a real CLI session actually edits the project; this proves the agent's tool use lands the
  exact requested bytes in the working directory, end to end.

### Ask policy with a gated tool and Allow → the hook fires and the write goes through
<!-- id: b4 -->
- **Why:** proves PreToolUse fires over ConPTY, carries the tool payload to the resolver, and an Allow lets
  the gated write complete — the live permission-request path.

### Ask policy with a gated tool and a denial → the write is blocked and the run does not hang
<!-- id: b5 -->
- **Why:** a null/deny resolution must block the gated tool and return cleanly, replacing acceptEdits' silent
  mid-turn hang.

### Auto policy with a gated tool → the tool runs without consulting the resolver
<!-- id: b6 -->
- **Why:** Auto auto-approves through the same gate without a human — the write runs even though the resolver
  would have denied, and the resolver is never consulted.

### a credentialed live turn → the subscription token never appears in the drive buffer
<!-- id: b7 -->
- **Why:** the credential rides `docker run`, not the PTY-echoed `docker exec` line, so a real billed turn's
  drive buffer (logged, surfaced to callers) must carry no `sk-ant-` token — the end-to-end proof the
  hardening keeps the subscription credential off the agent transcript.

### a Human agent given a registry answer → resumes and completes
<!-- id: b8 -->
- **Why:** InteractiveResolver parks the question and a registry answer resumes the live run to Completed —
  the inbox/endpoint resume loop against a real CLI.

### a Human agent with no answer available → escalates as Needs input
<!-- id: b9 -->
- **Why:** with no resolution a Human agent must surface NeedsInput rather than hang or guess — the
  deny-on-null escalation.

### the agent-configured machine → a real commit lands as the bot, never the owner or generic default
<!-- id: b10 -->
- **Why:** only the owner's real, agent-configured machine can prove the credential split holds — a probe
  commit is authored as the bot and the resolved identity is never the owner or the unconfigured Claude
  default; no scripted environment establishes which credential the live machine actually uses.
