## Summary
<!-- id: b1 -->
Each E2E Rule is one whole-flow guarantee, driven end to end through the real composition (real Steps, Flow engine, snapshot stream) with a scripted (non-CLI) provider or a real local tool. Enforced in each feature's co-located `src/<…>/<Owner>/Tests/E2E/` (`ABox.<Owner>.Tests`).

## Criteria

### one_flow
<!-- id: b2 -->
Describes exactly one whole-flow path to an end state, not several.

### observable_end
<!-- id: b3 -->
The result is an observable end state (terminal phase, commit/push, clean tree), not an internal step.

### why_justifies
<!-- id: b4 -->
The Why states the user-visible behaviour proven, not a restatement of the header.
