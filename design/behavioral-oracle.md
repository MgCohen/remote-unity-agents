# Behavioral Oracle

Empirical knowledge extracted from the prototype (`prototype-v0` tag), kept so a
rebuild doesn't silently lose it. **Read the tier distinction before using
anything here.**

## How to read this doc — two tiers

This doc is split into two tiers that must be treated **completely differently**:

- **Tier A — Invariants.** Facts about the outside world: how `claude` /
  `codex` / Windows / ConPTY actually behave. These are true regardless of how
  we build. **If the rebuild touches the relevant surface, it MUST honor
  these.** Breaking one is a bug, not a design choice.

- **Tier B — Prototype implementation notes.** How the *prototype* happened to
  solve things. **Do NOT treat these as requirements. Do NOT port them by
  default.** The rebuild is explicitly free — encouraged — to choose a
  different approach. They are recorded only so that *if* we independently
  decide to walk the same path, we don't re-pay the tuning cost or re-discover
  the same traps. **The default assumption for every Tier B item is "we will
  reconsider this," not "we will keep this."**

A Tier B item is never a reason to do something. It's a reference for *if* we
already decided to. When in doubt, an item is Tier B.

---

# Tier A — Invariants (honor these)

External truths. The rebuild must not violate any of these if it touches the
relevant surface.

## A1. Subscription billing trap

`claude` and `codex` bill against API keys — not the Max / ChatGPT
subscription — if **any** of these env vars are visible to the child process:

```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, CLAUDE_API_KEY, OPENAI_API_KEY
```

(canonical list: `Core/Primitives/EnvScrub.cs`)

To get subscription billing, the child must NOT see these. Whatever the rebuild
does, this is non-negotiable.

## A2. The ConPTY `isatty()` trick — SUPERSEDED (subscription now bills headless)

`claude` used to enable Max-subscription billing **only when `isatty()` is true
on both stdin and stdout** — so a plain `Process` (false) wouldn't bill the
subscription and Claude had to be driven through a pseudo-terminal.

**No longer binds (2026-07).** The policy that blocked using the subscription
non-interactively was rolled back: a `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` (from `claude
setup-token`) now bills the subscription under headless **`claude --print`**, no
TTY required. So Claude is driven headless over a plain `docker exec -i` pipe and
the ConPTY machinery is gone. **A1 still holds** — an `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` visible
to the child still overrides the OAuth token and bills the metered API, so it must
stay scrubbed. A4/A5/A7 below (the interactive-TUI facts) are retired with the PTY.

`codex exec` is officially supported non-interactively (since April 2026) and
does **not** need the PTY trick — a plain process is fine.

## A3. Codex model billing

`gpt-5.5` works on a ChatGPT subscription. `gpt-5.3-codex` (the codex CLI's
intrinsic default) is **API-only** and 400s out under subscription billing. Any
codex invocation that wants subscription billing must pass `--model gpt-5.5` (or
another subscription-eligible model) explicitly.

## A4. The cmd→claude silent gap

> Retired in headless mode (see A2): `claude --print` reads the prompt from stdin
> and needs no readiness detection. Kept as a record of the interactive TUI.

There is a **~2 second silent gap** between `cmd.exe` echoing the `claude`
command and `claude.exe` actually starting to paint. Any "wait until the
terminal goes quiet, then proceed" strategy that does **not** account for this
gap will mistake the gap for a settled TUI and send input before claude is
reading it. (The prototype's mitigation — a 3.5s floor — is Tier B; the *gap
itself* is the invariant.)

**Update (claude 2.1.158, 2026-06-03):** startup is *non-monotonic* — splash →
plugin load → `/remote-control` attach, with quiet gaps *between* render bursts.
So idle-settle is unreliable for readiness in general (not just the first gap): a
mid-startup lull is byte-identical to a settled prompt. The reliable signal is
**positive** — wait until the input bar is actually present (A7) plus a short
stability window, not until output stops. This supersedes the floor mitigation.

## A5. Claude TUI input is paste-sensitive

> Retired in headless mode (see A2): the prompt is fed on stdin, not typed into
> the TUI, so there is no paste/submit race. Kept as a record of the TUI.

Pressing Enter too quickly after typing into Claude's TUI causes the input to be
treated as a **bracketed paste** — it lands in the multi-line buffer instead of
submitting. A deliberate pause between "type the text" and "press Enter" is
required. (The prototype's 500ms value is Tier B; the *phenomenon* is the
invariant.)

## A6. Claude per-session JSONL — path & schema

If we choose to read Claude's transcript file (that choice is Tier B — see B5),
the file's location and shape are fixed by Claude Code:

- **Path:** `%USERPROFILE%\.claude\projects\<encoded-cwd>\<sessionId>.jsonl`
- **Cwd encoding:** path punctuation collapses to `-`. Originally documented as
  backslash / forward-slash / colon, but claude 2.1.158 **also collapses `.`**
  (e.g. a temp dir `…\claude-smoke-ab12.cd3` → `…-claude-smoke-ab12-cd3`) — the
  rule is lossier than first assumed, so a *computed* path is unreliable.
  **Resolve by the `<sessionId>.jsonl` filename instead** — the session id is a
  GUID we own and is unique, which sidesteps the encoding entirely.
  (current impl: `ClaudeJsonl.ResolveSessionFile`, globbing `projects\*\<id>.jsonl`)
- **Line schema:** one JSON object per line, e.g.

  ```json
  {"type":"assistant","message":{"role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"text","text":"..."}]}}
  ```

  `message.content` may be a bare string (legacy) or an array of typed blocks
  (`text`, `tool_use`, `tool_result`, `thinking`). Windows `FileStream` caches
  EOF, so re-reading a growing file requires re-opening it, not seeking.

## A7. Claude startup dialogs

> Retired in headless mode (see A2): `claude --print` suppresses the trust /
> bypass-warning dialogs (no TTY to show them), so there is nothing to detect or
> dismiss. Kept as a record of the interactive TUI.

Claude may interrupt startup with one of these dialogs. **The TUI positions each
glyph with cursor-move escapes, so the ANSI-stripped buffer has no inter-word
spaces** (`Is this a project you` renders as `Isthisaprojectyou`) — match against
a **whitespace-stripped** buffer with whitespace-free needles, not the spaced
phrases. (claude 2.1.158, 2026-06-03 — the prototype's spaced `Contains` silently
stopped matching, leaving the trust dialog undismissed.)

| Dialog | Substring match (shown spaced; matched whitespace-free) | Keystroke |
|---|---|---|
| Trust folder | `"trust this folder"` or `"Is this a project you"` (case-insensitive) | `\r` |
| Bypass-permissions warning | `"Bypass Permissions mode"` or `"Yes, I accept"` (case-sensitive) | `2\r` |

The same whitespace-free rule detects **prompt readiness**: the input bar's
`shift+tab` keybind hint is the positive "ready to accept a prompt" signal (A4).
The dialog wordings are Claude's; the keystrokes are what dismiss them. (current
impl: `ClaudeProtocol.DetectStartupDialog` / `IsPromptReady`, both over a
whitespace-normalized buffer. Whether we surface dismissal as an event, log line,
or nothing is Tier B.)

## A8. Claude CLI args

`--session-id` and `--resume` are **mutually exclusive** — pick by whether a
session is being resumed. Order:

```
claude
  ( --resume <id>     resuming
  | --session-id <id> new session )
  [--permission-mode <mode>]
  [--model <model>]
  [--append-system-prompt <text>]
```

## A9. Codex CLI args & hook trap

```
codex
  ( exec                            new session
  | exec resume <id> )              resuming
  --cd <projectDir>
  -o <lastMessageFile>             captures final assistant text
  --sandbox <policy>
  --dangerously-bypass-hook-trust  skips per-hook trust gate
  --skip-git-repo-check            run in non-git / first-seen dirs
  --json
  [--model <model>]
  -                                read prompt from stdin
```

**Hook trap (hard-won):** the old `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox`
flag **also silently disabled hook invocation** — `hooks.jsonl` stayed empty
under it. Do not reintroduce it. `codex exec` is autonomous by default; the flag
set above gives autonomy *with hooks active*.

- `-o <file>` mirrors what a Stop hook's `last_assistant_message` would contain.
- Codex session id can appear on a `--json` line as any of: top-level
  `thread_id` / `session_id` / `sessionId`; nested `thread.id` / `session.id`;
  or `payload.thread_id` / `payload.session_id`. Minimum meaningful length 8.
  (current impl: `CodexSessionId.Scan`)

## A10. Process-tree teardown (anti-zombie)

On Windows, Porta.Pty puts the spawned tree (`cmd` → `claude` → whatever claude
spawned) under a **Job Object with kill-on-close**. Disposing the PTY connection
cascades the kill to every descendant. The invariant: **something must
guarantee the PTY connection is actually disposed even when the child hangs** —
otherwise orphaned processes survive (the prototype-era failure was JS zombies
running for weeks). Any rebuild that drives a child process needs an equivalent
hard-kill guarantee.

## B1. Claude TUI choreography & timings

The prototype drives Claude as a scripted PTY session
(`ClaudeAgent.DriveAsync` + `PtySession`): write `claude <args>`, wait for
splash to settle, dismiss dialog, type prompt + pause + Enter, wait for reply to
settle, `/exit`, wait, `exit`. **This whole "blind idle-settle scripting"
approach is a candidate for replacement** (e.g. waiting on an explicit
prompt-ready marker instead of "the terminal went quiet"). **Superseded for
readiness (claude 2.1.158, 2026-06-03):** the rebuild waits on a positive
input-bar marker + stability window (A4/A7), so the launch-settle idle + floor
rows below are no longer used; the response/exit-settle idle rows still are. If
the idle approach is ever revisited, the tuned values were:

| Stage | Knob | Value | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| Launch settle (idle) | `LaunchSettleIdleMs` | 1000 | quiet this long ⇒ splash done |
| Launch settle (floor) | `LaunchSettleMinWaitMs` | 3500 | covers the A4 gap on a warm machine |
| Launch settle (cap) | hard-coded | 8000 | ceiling on splash wait |
| Submit settle | hard-coded (`SubmitAsync`) | 500 | the A5 anti-paste pause |
| Response settle (idle) | `IdleThresholdMs` | 6000 | quiet this long ⇒ reply done |
| Response settle (cap) | `MaxWaitMs` | 300000 (5 min) | cap on response wait |
| Exit settle (idle) | `ExitSettleIdleMs` | 500 | wait for goodbye to print |
| Exit settle (cap) | hard-coded | 5000 | ceiling on exit wait |
| Process exit | `WaitForExitMs` | 15000 | before Kill |
| Reader drain | `ReaderDrainMs` | 2000 | grace for reader after clean exit |
| Overall deadline | `MaxOverallMs` | 600000 (10 min) | wall-clock cap; linked CTS ⇒ teardown |
| JSONL final flush | hard-coded | 400 | Claude lags ~100ms writing last line after PTY close |
| Idle poll resolution | `WaitIdleAsync` pollMs | 100 | how often idle is checked |

PTY runs inside `cmd.exe /c` (`PtyOptions.App` → `System32\cmd.exe`). Writes the
literal line `claude <quoted args>` + `\r`, then `/exit` + `\r`, then `exit` +
`\r`. Cols×Rows default 120×40.

**The "idle-settle" detection strategy is itself Tier B** — all the idle/floor
values above are tuning *for that strategy*. A marker-based or structured-output
strategy would discard the whole table.

## B2. PTY shutdown ordering

The prototype satisfies A10 via `PtySession.ShutdownAsync` / `DisposeAsync`:

- **Happy path:** wait `WaitForExitMs` for exit → give the reader task
  `ReaderDrainMs` to drain trailing bytes → if it doesn't drain, cancel it.
  Reader is *not* cancelled on the happy path (would truncate the final chunk).
- **Kill path:** `_pty.Kill()` → cancel reader → dispose (Job Object cascades).
  Exit code is **forced to −1 even if the PTY reported 0** ("Kill is never
  success").

A rebuild must satisfy A10, but is free to structure the teardown differently.

## B3. Codex driving

The prototype runs `codex exec` as a plain `Process` under `cmd.exe /c`
(`CodexAgent.DriveAsync` + `SubprocessSession`): prompt on stdin, final text
captured from the `-o` temp file (`%TEMP%\agents-codex-<guid>\last.txt`),
session id sniffed live from the `--json` stdout line stream. Defaults
(`CodexAgentOptions`): `Sandbox = "workspace-write"`, `JsonStreamTimeoutMs =
60000` (the host overrides the reviewer role to 5 min and `sandbox = read-only`),
`Model = "gpt-5.5"`.

**Synthetic stop line** — when text was captured via `-o` but hooks didn't fire,
the prototype appends this to `hooks.jsonl` so a single hook-based resolver still
finds the text:

```json
{"ts":"<iso8601>","source":"codex.stop","sessionId":"<id|empty>","cwd":"<projectDir>",
 "payload":{"last_assistant_message":"<text>","_synthetic":"codex.text"}}
```

This whole synthetic-line dance exists only because the prototype routes *all*
result resolution through hooks (see B4). A rebuild that reads the `-o` file
directly wouldn't need it.

## B4. Hook-based result resolution

The prototype's only mechanism for "did the agent pause to ask / finish / fail"
is parsing a `hooks.jsonl` the provider's shim writes (`HookIntegration`,
`ClaudeHookParser` / `CodexHookParser`). It installs `.claude/settings.json`
(Claude) or `~/.codex/hooks.json` (Codex, user-global) pointing at a shim,
sets `REMOTEAGENTS_HOOKS_JSONL` on the child env, parses after the run,
uninstalls on dispose.

**This is a heavy mechanism and a prime rebuild reconsideration.** Whether
"agent asked a question" should be detected via hooks, via structured CLI
output, or another way is an open design question — do not assume hooks.

## B5. JSONL as the authoritative text source

The prototype treats the Claude per-session JSONL file (A6) as the
**authoritative** source for last-turn text, with the ANSI-stripped PTY buffer
as fallback only (`ClaudeJsonl.TryReadLastAssistantText`; full transcript via
`TryReadLastTurnTranscript`). It reads the file **once, after the run
completes**.

**"Use JSONL as the source of truth" is a design decision, not a requirement.**
The rebuild might read the `-o`-style output, parse structured CLI output, or
scrape the buffer. A6 only tells you the file's shape *if* you choose to read
it — it does not tell you that you should.

**Update (rebuild, 2026-06-03):** the buffer fallback was **removed** — the
de-spaced TUI buffer (A7) can't reliably yield prose, so a raw `IndexOf(prompt)`
returns nothing in practice; it was false comfort. The rebuild reads JSONL only
(resolved by sessionId — A6), polled briefly for the final-flush lag, and keeps
the raw buffer solely as `RawOutput` for debugging.
