# Repo-hooks consumer: on a doc change, validate the instances that changed and — on a turn end —
# spawn fresh reviewers whose feedback returns to the main session. Triggered by
# tools/doc-engine/on-doc-change.hook (TurnEnded / CommitLanded). The repo-hooks controller owns the
# trigger; this script is pure doc-engine and carries no knowledge of any provider.
#
# This is a `mode: check` handler — its output is fed back to the running agent. The pipeline:
#   1. docengine validate  — deterministic, free, shape-only. An invalid doc exits non-zero to BLOCK
#      the turn-end, feeding the structural error back so the agent fixes it before stopping.
#   2. onChange script      — a deterministic side-effect handler, if the doc declares one.
#   3. fresh reviewers      — one per docType `reviewers:` entry (judge always; guide adds walk-guide),
#      spawned as a brand-new `claude -p --agent <name>` so the main session never grades its own work
#      (no bias, no context bloat). Launched HOOK-FREE (ABOX_HOOKS_SUPPRESS) so a reviewer can't
#      re-trigger this hook. Reviewers are ADVISORY (their notes ride back as context); only the
#      deterministic validate blocks. Reviewers run on a turn end only — a commit has no agent to feed.
# CI's Docs test remains the hard backstop; this is the fast, in-loop nudge.
