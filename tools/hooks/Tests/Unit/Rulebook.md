## Rules

### Glob matches ** across directories and * within a single segment
<!-- id: b1 -->
- **Why:** the `when: cwd glob` filter decides which sessions a hook reacts to, so `**` must span nested
  directories while `*` stays inside one segment — collapse the distinction and a hook fires on the wrong tree.

### HookManifestParser parses a well-formed .hook into its kinds, when-filter, mode, and run command
<!-- id: b2 -->
- **Why:** the `.hook` file is the whole feature-facing seam; if the parser drops the `on:` kinds, the `when:`
  filter, the mode, or the run command, a feature's declared intent is silently not what the controller runs.

### HookManifestParser rejects a .hook missing on: or an action with an actionable error naming the file
<!-- id: b3 -->
- **Why:** `on:` and an action (`run:` or `agent:`) are the load-bearing fields — a hook with neither an event to
  fire on nor an action to take is inert, so it must fail loudly, naming the file, not be a silent no-op.

### HookManifestParser parses agent: into a spawn-agent action carrying the prompt
<!-- id: b4 -->
- **Why:** `agent:` is the second action axis — instead of a shell command it names a prompt for a fresh agent, so
  the parser must capture it as a spawn-agent action (not a run command) or the fresh-review intent is lost.

### HookManifestParser rejects a .hook that sets both run: and agent:
<!-- id: b5 -->
- **Why:** a hook takes exactly one action; allowing both leaves it ambiguous which one fires, so two actions must
  fail loudly at parse time rather than silently picking one.

### HookEvent round-trips through its jsonl line, preserving kind, source, ids, and raw payload
<!-- id: b6 -->
- **Why:** the jsonl line is the transport between the dumb shim and the controller; a consumer reads the kind,
  source, and ids and may reach into the raw payload, so the line must reconstruct the event without loss.

### HookEvent.TryParse rejects a malformed or kindless line
<!-- id: b7 -->
- **Why:** the log is appended to by external shims and can carry a torn or junk line; parsing must reject it
  by returning false rather than throwing, so one bad line never aborts the whole dispatch pass.

### HookManifest.Matches gates on event kind and the when-filter
<!-- id: b8 -->
- **Why:** matching is the controller's core decision — a hook must run only when the event kind is in its
  `on:` set and every present `when:` clause (source, cwd glob, tool) holds, never on a near-miss.

### HookCatalog discovers .hook files under its scan roots and reports a malformed one instead of throwing
<!-- id: b9 -->
- **Why:** discovery is convention-over-registration across many feature folders; one malformed `.hook` must be
  reported and skipped, leaving the rest discoverable, so a single typo can't blind the controller to every hook.

### HookDispatcher runs the matching notify and check hooks, not gate, feeding the event on stdin
<!-- id: b10 -->
- **Why:** `notify` and `check` hooks both fan out off the event with the payload on stdin; a non-matching hook
  or a `gate` hook (which rides the synchronous perm-shim, not this stream) must not be run here, or the wrong
  code fires — `check` differs only in that its captured output is relayed back to the agent, not discarded.

### HookDispatcher routes an agent: action to the agent launcher, not the shell, and relays its output
<!-- id: b11 -->
- **Why:** an `agent:` action must reach the agent launcher (a fresh `claude -p`), never the shell runner — and its
  output must come back as the result so a `check` hook can feed the fresh review to the main agent.

### HookController dispatches the pending log slice once and advances the cursor past completed lines
<!-- id: b12 -->
- **Why:** the durable cursor is what makes delivery deferred-not-dropped — it must advance past completed lines
  after dispatch (so a line isn't re-run forever) yet leave a torn trailing line for the next pass.

### GitInstaller.InstallPostCommit on a default repo → writes an executable post-commit that calls abox-hooks commit
<!-- id: b13 -->
- **Why:** the git source is wired by a post-commit hook; the installer must drop an executable hook that calls
  back into the CLI, or commits never produce a CommitLanded event and the whole git path is inert.

### GitInstaller.InstallPostCommit on a repo with a custom core.hooksPath → refuses without writing a hook
<!-- id: b14 -->
- **Why:** a repo with a managed hooks dir (this one uses governance `.githooks`) must not be silently hijacked —
  the installer refuses and tells the user to wire it by hand, rather than clobbering or being silently ignored.

### abox-hooks commit in an opted-in repo → appends a CommitLanded line and dispatches matching hooks
<!-- id: b15 -->
- **Why:** this is the post-commit entry point and the git half of the transport — it must read HEAD, append a
  well-formed CommitLanded line carrying the sha, and dispatch so a commit triggers its reactions immediately.

### abox-hooks commit with no .abox opt-in → emits nothing
<!-- id: b16 -->
- **Why:** emission is opt-in per repo (an `.abox/` dir), so a commit in a repo that wants no hooks must leave no
  hooks.jsonl behind — the same opt-in contract the Claude turn-end emit honors.

### ClaudeCodeInstaller.InstallStopHook → wires a turn-ended Stop hook into settings, preserving existing keys
<!-- id: b17 -->
- **Why:** this is how repo-hooks fires in a normal Claude Code session (not just orchestration) — it must add a
  `Stop` hook that calls `turn-ended` while merging into existing settings, never clobbering other keys or hooks.

### ClaudeCodeInstaller.InstallStopHook on a settings already wired → no duplicate Stop hook
<!-- id: b18 -->
- **Why:** install must be idempotent — re-running it (or running it in an already-set-up repo) must not stack
  duplicate Stop hooks that would emit the same event many times per turn.

### abox-hooks turn-ended in an opted-in repo → appends a TurnEnded line from the Stop payload and dispatches
<!-- id: b19 -->
- **Why:** this is the dev-loop producer — given the Claude Code Stop payload on stdin it must emit a well-formed
  TurnEnded line (carrying the session id and raw payload) and dispatch, so a normal session fires hooks too.

### abox-hooks turn-ended with a passing check hook → returns the check output as advisory Stop context
<!-- id: b20 -->
- **Why:** a `check` hook is the synchronous, fed-back mode — when it passes (exit 0) its stdout must come back as
  advisory context so the producer can inject it via the Stop hook's `additionalContext`, guiding without blocking.

### abox-hooks turn-ended with a failing check hook → blocks the turn, feeding the check output back as the reason
<!-- id: b21 -->
- **Why:** the whole point of `check` is to let a reaction stop a premature turn-end — a non-zero check must surface
  as a block whose reason is the hook's output, which the producer renders as a Stop exit-2 fed back to the agent.

### abox-hooks turn-ended honors stop_hook_active → a blocking check is downgraded to context, not re-blocked
<!-- id: b22 -->
- **Why:** Claude sets `stop_hook_active` once a stop has already been blocked and resumed; if a check still wants
  to block, re-blocking would wedge the agent in an endless block→resume loop, so the guard downgrades it to
  advisory context — the reason is still surfaced, but the turn is allowed to end.

### abox-hooks turn-ended under ABOX_HOOKS_SUPPRESS → no-op, so a hook-spawned agent can't re-trigger
<!-- id: b23 -->
- **Why:** a reviewer launched by an `agent:` action carries `ABOX_HOOKS_SUPPRESS`; its own turn-end must emit and
  dispatch nothing, or the fresh review would re-trigger the hook that spawned it — the structural loop guard.

### abox-hooks turn-ended with no .abox opt-in → emits nothing
<!-- id: b24 -->
- **Why:** a Stop hook fires every turn, so without the `.abox/` opt-in it must be a silent no-op — never writing
  a stream into a repo that did not ask for one.
